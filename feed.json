There were actually <em>five</em> lectures that sparked an interest in design research and grad school. All of them held in vast hotel meeting rooms with hundreds of attendees, but each of them connecting with me on a deeper level.</p>\n<p><strong>Jonah Lehrer, AIGA Gain Conference, October 2008, New York City</strong></p>\n<p>Gain was AIGA’s &ldquo;Business of Design&rdquo; conference<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> and there was a roster of big wig, influential speakers.

Lehrer connected creativity with neuroscience advancements, arguing that artists often figured out how the brain worked before scientists did. This concept that neuroscience and creativity could be linked was fascinating to me. A few years after this talk, Lehrer was found to have plagiarized and fabricated quotes in his later works, making this a strange choice to start my list, but after his talk, I started to think about design work a little differently. <a href=\"https://www.aiga.org/inspiration/talks/jonah-lehrer-2008-gain-conference\">There is a recording of the talk, but sadly, no audio for some reason.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm Gladwell, AIGA Gain Conference, October 2008, New York City</strong></p>\n<p>Same conference as Jonah Lehrer, but one day later. Malcolm Gladwell spoke about his forthcoming book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930\">Outliers</a>. People often criticize Gladwell for oversimplifying the research he builds on, but in that moment — combined with the Lehrer speech the day before — I could see connections between social sciences and design.

Looking back at my notes and blog posts, I wrote about the inspiring speakers, the networking and the creative exploration of letterpress and hand lettering. I did not specifically note a lecture by Kevin Larson, which is really funny, because that’s the one that ended up being most influential for me. Larson is research scientist working for Microsoft and I remember his talk about the science of readability. How does the human brain process letterforms? And then form words and meaning? His general idea was that designers think they understand how readability works, but research shows that other factors are involved and room for improvement. There isn’t a recording around that I’m aware of, but I did find a <a href=\"https://atypi.org/presentation/designing-with-science/\">2013 talk with Larson and legendary designer Matthew Carter discussing collaborating on the design of a typeface</a> using letter recognition testing.

In actuality, I left pondering the difference between designing to persuade and designing to inform. Too often, we don’t try to communicate information and let viewers come to their own conclusions.

				"content_html": "<p>I realized the other day that our family tends to give places nicknames and that to an outside observer, our place names would be undecodable. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>St. Mary Ashley.</strong> In reality, this church is St. Mary Episcopal Church, but our former babysitter, Mary Ashley got married here. It’s on my drive home and when my wife would ask where I was, I’d say “I’m by St. Mary, you know, where Mary Ashley got married.” Eventually, I shortened it to St. Mary Ashley.</li>\n<li><strong>The Honeybaked Ham Plant.</strong> Not far past St. Mary Ashley is sprawling industrial facility. Once owned by Honeywell, it’s now operated by Shaw Industries and makes carpet fibers.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> It obviously does not &ldquo;make&rdquo; hams, but I guess at some point, Honeywell became Honeybaked. If I told my wife I was near the Shaw Industries plant, she’d have no idea where I was.</li>\n<li><strong>The Ballerina Gas Station.</strong> It’s in Ballentine, South Carolina and when Norah was very little, she misunderstood where we were stopping to fill up. It stuck.(I found out recently that at least one of my kids thought it was really called the Ballerina Gas Station.)</li>\n<li><strong>All the Starbucks.</strong> We have nicknames for all of our frequent Starbucks stops. “Neighborhood Starbucks” is by our house and is a typical new Starbucks. “Grad School Starbucks” is where I did all my grad school studying when I first went back to school. It was the closest to our house until Neighborhood Starbucks was built.

				"content_text": "I realized the other day that our family tends to give places nicknames and that to an outside observer, our place names would be undecodable. Here are a few of my favorites.\r\n\r\n* **St. Mary Ashley.** In reality, this church is St. Mary Episcopal Church, but our former babysitter, Mary Ashley got married here. It’s on my drive home and when my wife would ask where I was, I’d say “I’m by St. Mary, you know, where Mary Ashley got married.” Eventually, I shortened it to St. Mary Ashley.\r\n* **The Honeybaked Ham Plant.** Not far past St. Mary Ashley is sprawling industrial facility. Once owned by Honeywell, it’s now operated by Shaw Industries and makes carpet fibers.[^1] It obviously does not \"make\" hams, but I guess at some point, Honeywell became Honeybaked. If I told my wife I was near the Shaw Industries plant, she’d have no idea where I was.\r\n* **The Ballerina Gas Station.** It’s in Ballentine, South Carolina and when Norah was very little, she misunderstood where we were stopping to fill up. It stuck.(I found out recently that at least one of my kids thought it was really called the Ballerina Gas Station.)\r\n* **All the Starbucks.** We have nicknames for all of our frequent Starbucks stops. “Neighborhood Starbucks” is by our house and is a typical new Starbucks. “Grad School Starbucks” is where I did all my grad school studying when I first went back to school. It was the closest to our house until Neighborhood Starbucks was built. It is also an icebox so it's important to let the kids know if we are going to Grad School Starbucks because they will need a sweatshirt. “Ballerina Starbucks” is in Ballentine, obviously. (See above.) A Starbucks without a nickname is a Starbucks that we don’t visit.[^2]\r\n\r\nThere are others. Are we the only family that does this? Or does your family have informal names for places that you visit?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Bob Wertz is a type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

				"title": "I love Iconfactory’s Tapestry – a unified timeline for my iPhone",
				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"new-app-lets-ios-users-weave-together-sources\">New app lets iOS users weave together sources</h2>\n<p>When the Iconfactory announced their Tapestry Kickstarter, I backed it immediately. I’ve been a fan of the Iconfactory’s work for decades, and was a loyal user of Twitteriffic before Musk cut off the API. I’ve had beta access for months as a Kickstarter perk and I’ve been using it daily.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> <a href=\"https://usetapestry.com\">Now that Tapestry is released to everyone,</a> I wanted to write a little review with some thoughts about how it’s working for me.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><strong>One app for pretty much everything.</strong> Tapestry is a unified feed reader. You build a feed from a variety of sources and “connectors.” I’ve used connectors to bring in my Micro.Blog, Mastodon and Bluesky social timelines. I still use Feedbin as a traditional feed reader so I’ve also some of my favorite RSS feeds and some YouTube channels. I even have a podcast feed in there and, while I wouldn’t listen to a long podcast in Tapestry, it does works for short audio files. All of it pulled together into a single timeline.</p>\n<p><strong>You said “pretty much everything?”</strong> Correct. To be added to Tapestry, the sources need to connect to the open web. That means no Meta apps. So if you want to connect to Instagram, Facebook or Threads, there isn’t an API to allow for a connection. This isn’t a problem with Tapestry, it’s a problem with Meta. But don’t get me started on the importance of open APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm free.</strong> Tapestry doesn’t add any annoying algorithms to your content feed. You decide who you want to follow, and you see their posts in the order in which they were shared. No engagement manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction.</strong> You can’t like or comment directly from the Tapestry interface, but it’s easy to swipe and access a Safari web view. For example, if I see a Bluesky post I want to like, I swipe and Bluesky opens. I like the post, click done at the top left, and I’m back to my feed. It’s a smart solution to a complex problem. I’m not someone who likes or comments a bunch so this little bit of friction is completely acceptable to me. I understand if this isn’t enough for you, but it works for me. You can “Mark” items for follow up later, and I find that helpful for keeping track of good links and stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Muffle and Mute.</strong> You can build rules to muffle (collapse) or mute (hide) posts that contain keywords. I find this to be incredibly powerful. There’s a person I know — who I want to follow — who shares his Wordle every day. So I muffled “Wordle” in my feed. You can build those rules to hide whatever you don’t want to see. I loved it in Twitteriffic and will absolutely use this in Tapestry.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Opportunities and rough edges.</strong> This is a 1.0 version. There are rough edges, but also clear opportunities for them to improve the app. The Iconfactory is committed to improving Tapestry and offering a Mac version eventually. I’m excited about where this is going.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed Tapestry because I can just dip into the most recent information. And since Micro.Blog and Bluesky are currently my most used services, this integrates perfectly.

				"content_text": "## New app lets iOS users weave together sources\nWhen the Iconfactory announced their Tapestry Kickstarter, I backed it immediately. I’ve been a fan of the Iconfactory’s work for decades, and was a loyal user of Twitteriffic before Musk cut off the API. I’ve had beta access for months as a Kickstarter perk and I’ve been using it daily.[^1] [Now that Tapestry is released to everyone,](https://usetapestry.com) I wanted to write a little review with some thoughts about how it’s working for me.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/tapestry-example.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"629\" alt=\"Screenshots of Tapestry, a unified feed reader for iOS.\">\n\n**One app for pretty much everything.** Tapestry is a unified feed reader. You build a feed from a variety of sources and “connectors.” I’ve used connectors to bring in my Micro.Blog, Mastodon and Bluesky social timelines. I still use Feedbin as a traditional feed reader so I’ve also some of my favorite RSS feeds and some YouTube channels. I even have a podcast feed in there and, while I wouldn’t listen to a long podcast in Tapestry, it does works for short audio files. All of it pulled together into a single timeline.\n\n**You said “pretty much everything?”** Correct. To be added to Tapestry, the sources need to connect to the open web. That means no Meta apps. So if you want to connect to Instagram, Facebook or Threads, there isn’t an API to allow for a connection. This isn’t a problem with Tapestry, it’s a problem with Meta. But don’t get me started on the importance of open APIs.\n\n**Algorithm free.** Tapestry doesn’t add any annoying algorithms to your content feed. You decide who you want to follow, and you see their posts in the order in which they were shared. No engagement manipulation.\n\n**Interaction.** You can’t like or comment directly from the Tapestry interface, but it’s easy to swipe and access a Safari web view. For example, if I see a Bluesky post I want to like, I swipe and Bluesky opens. I like the post, click done at the top left, and I’m back to my feed. It’s a smart solution to a complex problem. I’m not someone who likes or comments a bunch so this little bit of friction is completely acceptable to me. I understand if this isn’t enough for you, but it works for me. You can “Mark” items for follow up later, and I find that helpful for keeping track of good links and stories.\n\n**Muffle and Mute.** You can build rules to muffle (collapse) or mute (hide) posts that contain keywords. I find this to be incredibly powerful. There’s a person I know — who I want to follow — who shares his Wordle every day. So I muffled “Wordle” in my feed. You can build those rules to hide whatever you don’t want to see. I loved it in Twitteriffic and will absolutely use this in Tapestry.[^2]\n\n**Opportunities and rough edges.** This is a 1.0 version. There are rough edges, but also clear opportunities for them to improve the app. The Iconfactory is committed to improving Tapestry and offering a Mac version eventually. I’m excited about where this is going.\n\nI've really enjoyed Tapestry because I can just dip into the most recent information. And since Micro.Blog and Bluesky are currently my most used services, this integrates perfectly. It's tough to explain, but it brings a social media style timeline together for a wider variety of sources. It's not for everyone, but it is absolutely what I want.\n\nTapestry is now available on the App Store for iOS [free with ads. Or if you want no ads and premium features, it's just $1.99 a month or $19.99 a year.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tapestry-by-iconfactory/id6448078074)\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

The start of the year has been chaotic. Cold weather and threat of snow, but only a couple of flurries. Then, last week, both kids had the flu. The semester started and I'm taking two classes. Work remains busy. Tomorrow is MLK Day and it's a holiday for us. Hoping to use the day off to recharge and reset.\n \n### Feels\n* <strong>Anxious.</strong> A car accident before Christmas. Wildfires in California. Insane political news. Sick kiddos. The general state of the world. It's just one thing after another.\n* <strong>Optimistic.</strong> While the state of the world is depressing, I'm excited about the direction at work. And I'm moving toward finishing my Ph.D.\n\n### Health\n* <strong>Still stalled.</strong> Had hoped to hit reset after the new year, but alas, things are just too chaotic. I was looking to start walking more this week, but the weather looks terrible. So maybe I'm heading to the gym until the weather improves? Don't know, but I need to kick my fitness routine into gear.\n\n### Projects\n* <strong>Typeface design.</strong> Spent a little time working on my new typeface design. Happy with the little prototype that I built.\n* <strong>My blog.</strong> Thinking about some things I might want to change here. I'm more sure than ever that my Micro.Blog hosted site is the best possible option.\n\n\n### Entertainment\n* <strong>Skeleton Crew.</strong> So good. I enjoyed the show from start to finish. And the finale briefly shows my favorite ships of all time. I won't spoil it for you.\n* <strong>South Carolina Women's Basketball.</strong> Go Gamecocks. They are ranked #2 because of a loss to UCLA, but they look like they will fight for another national championship. They are so much fun to watch.\n* <strong>NFL Playoffs. </strong> I didn't watch a lot of the regular season, but I'm tuned into the playoffs.

I&rsquo;ve had an account since I backed the Kickstarter in 2017, but recently, I’ve started slowly moving everything from my old Squarespace<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blog Hosting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This blog is hosted on Micro.Blog. I’m in the process of migrating my favorite old posts from Sketchbook B here so everything is in one place. At the $10/month premium subscription level, I can even add a few more blogs if I want to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Site Hosting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href=\"http://sbbfonts.com\">SbBFonts.com</a> is a static site hosted on Micro.Blog that features my typeface designs. I’ve got other ideas for simple sites I want to build. These &ldquo;single page sites&rdquo; are completely underrated feature of Micro.Blog and included with the premium plan. I love the flexibility of adding these kind of sites quickly and easily.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Social timeline.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I use Micro.Blog’s timeline to interact with other Micro.Blog users and to follow Mastodon and other Fediverse accounts. It’s not the most active timeline because there is no algorithm pushing content at you. I consider that a feature, not a drawback. It&rsquo;s not a replacement for other social sites like Mastodon, Threads or Bluesky, but it is a nice alternative.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crossposting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Social media is fragmenting. When I post to Micro.Blog, I have it configured to automatically crosspost to Bluesky and Threads. I could also crosspost to LinkedIn, but I don’t want everything I post copied over there. People on Mastodon can follow my Micro.Blog posts at <a href=\"mailto:bobwertz@bobwertz.com\">bobwertz@bobwertz.com</a>. And the service keeps evolving. Micro.Blog founder <a href=\"https://www.manton.org\">Manton Reese</a> is great about adding features as new APIs are released or updated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Tweet Archive.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Just because I left Twitter didn’t mean I wanted to lose all my tweets. Manton built a way to import my tweets and I now have a <a href=\"https://bobwertz.com/tweets/\">searchable archive of 15 years of Twitter posts</a> on my own site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Third-party Tools.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The web interface for Micro.Blog is fine, but I like using different apps, too. I can post directly to Micro.Blog from <a href=\"https://ulysses.app\">Ulysses</a> and <a href=\"https://redsweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit</a>. <a href=\"https://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a> has a nice little integration, too, but I don’t use it much. It’s nice to have options, something that Squarespace doesn’t offer.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are other features that I don’t take advantage of yet like email newsletters, podcasts and narrated posts. All of these are included with my plan, I just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to using them yet.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I know that Micro.Blog isn’t for everyone. It’s easy to get started, but to get maximum customization, you need to be comfortable with tinkering. The text editor uses <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a>, which I like, but many people have never heard of. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Micro.Blog has no built in metrics. This is by design and I think it&rsquo;s a good thing, but if you are the type of person who wants to dig into the metrics of every post, this probably isn&rsquo;t the service for you.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Micro.Blog is exactly what I want in a service. A home for all of my random thoughts, projects and experiments. The service provides an incredible amount of value for $5 or $10 a month and it feels like the web I fell in love with.

				"content_text": "I was thinking this week about how Micro.Blog has become the home base for all of my online activity. I've had an account since I backed the Kickstarter in 2017, but recently, I’ve started slowly moving everything from my old Squarespace[^1] site:\n\n* <strong>Blog Hosting.</strong> This blog is hosted on Micro.Blog. I’m in the process of migrating my favorite old posts from Sketchbook B here so everything is in one place. At the $10/month premium subscription level, I can even add a few more blogs if I want to.\n\n* <strong>Site Hosting.</strong> [SbBFonts.com](http://sbbfonts.com) is a static site hosted on Micro.Blog that features my typeface designs. I’ve got other ideas for simple sites I want to build. These \"single page sites\" are completely underrated feature of Micro.Blog and included with the premium plan. I love the flexibility of adding these kind of sites quickly and easily.\n\n* <strong>Social timeline.</strong> I use Micro.Blog’s timeline to interact with other Micro.Blog users and to follow Mastodon and other Fediverse accounts. It’s not the most active timeline because there is no algorithm pushing content at you. I consider that a feature, not a drawback. It's not a replacement for other social sites like Mastodon, Threads or Bluesky, but it is a nice alternative.\n\n* <strong>Crossposting.</strong> Social media is fragmenting. When I post to Micro.Blog, I have it configured to automatically crosspost to Bluesky and Threads. I could also crosspost to LinkedIn, but I don’t want everything I post copied over there. People on Mastodon can follow my Micro.Blog posts at bobwertz@bobwertz.com. And the service keeps evolving. Micro.Blog founder [Manton Reese](https://www.manton.org) is great about adding features as new APIs are released or updated. \n\n* <strong>My Tweet Archive.</strong> Just because I left Twitter didn’t mean I wanted to lose all my tweets. Manton built a way to import my tweets and I now have a [searchable archive of 15 years of Twitter posts](https://bobwertz.com/tweets/) on my own site.\n\n* <strong>Third-party Tools.</strong> The web interface for Micro.Blog is fine, but I like using different apps, too. I can post directly to Micro.Blog from [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) and [MarsEdit](https://redsweater.com/marsedit/). [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) has a nice little integration, too, but I don’t use it much. It’s nice to have options, something that Squarespace doesn’t offer.[^2]\n\nThere are other features that I don’t take advantage of yet like email newsletters, podcasts and narrated posts. All of these are included with my plan, I just haven't gotten around to using them yet.\n\n---\n\nI know that Micro.Blog isn’t for everyone. It’s easy to get started, but to get maximum customization, you need to be comfortable with tinkering. The text editor uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which I like, but many people have never heard of. It's worth noting that Micro.Blog has no built in metrics. This is by design and I think it's a good thing, but if you are the type of person who wants to dig into the metrics of every post, this probably isn't the service for you.[^3]\n\nMicro.Blog is exactly what I want in a service. A home for all of my random thoughts, projects and experiments. The service provides an incredible amount of value for $5 or $10 a month and it feels like the web I fell in love with. If it aligns with your needs, there really isn't a better service.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n\n[^1]: Squarespace seems to be trying to serve a business audience with a ton of features that I really don't need.

This makes me nervous.\n\n[^2]: When I first started using Squarespace, there was an API, but they phased out support for that a long time ago.\n\n[^3]: You can add metrics through some other third party services, but I personally want to remain blissfully ignorant.

				"title": "15 years of Fontstruct",
				"content_html": "<p>I realized this morning that I’ve been using Fontstruct for 15 years. Fontstruct is an online tool for building modular typefaces. My first typeface design — Big Thursday — debuted on May 26, 2009. Since then, <a href=\"https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/154783/sketchbook_b\">I’ve publicly released 49 fonts on Fontstruct</a> and 19 have been selected as “Staff Picks.”</p>\n<p>The original version didn’t have a lot of flexibility,<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> but over time developer Rob Meek has added new brick types, construction methods, kerning, support for color fonts and other features to Fontstruct to make it more powerful. My work tends to be a little brutalist, but if you want to understand the flexibility of the tool, check out <a href=\"https://fontstruct.com/gallery?filters=staff-picks-only&amp;order=by-balanced-rating\">the gallery</a> to see what amazing creations people can craft with this online tool.</p>\n<p>I don’t use the most complicated features, but I sometimes use Fontstruct to prototype an idea for a new typeface. One of Fontstruct’s best integrations is that I can download a file that I can open and refine in Glyphs.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> I recently created a design, moved it to Glyphs and built a variable font out of it.</p>\n<p>Balancing work, family, grad school and other obligations, I don’t have a ton of time to spend in Fontstruct. But when they rolled out the Patron level of support for 5 euro a month, I subscribed immediately.

				"content_text": "I realized this morning that I’ve been using Fontstruct for 15 years. Fontstruct is an online tool for building modular typefaces. My first typeface design — Big Thursday — debuted on May 26, 2009. Since then, [I’ve publicly released 49 fonts on Fontstruct](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/154783/sketchbook_b) and 19 have been selected as “Staff Picks.”\n\nThe original version didn’t have a lot of flexibility,[^1] but over time developer Rob Meek has added new brick types, construction methods, kerning, support for color fonts and other features to Fontstruct to make it more powerful. My work tends to be a little brutalist, but if you want to understand the flexibility of the tool, check out [the gallery](https://fontstruct.com/gallery?filters=staff-picks-only&order=by-balanced-rating) to see what amazing creations people can craft with this online tool.\n\nI don’t use the most complicated features, but I sometimes use Fontstruct to prototype an idea for a new typeface. One of Fontstruct’s best integrations is that I can download a file that I can open and refine in Glyphs.[^2] I recently created a design, moved it to Glyphs and built a variable font out of it.\n\nBalancing work, family, grad school and other obligations, I don’t have a ton of time to spend in Fontstruct. But when they rolled out the Patron level of support for 5 euro a month, I subscribed immediately. I’m happy to support independent tools that are constantly improving.\n\nI pulled together a sample of some of the designs I've created over the years on Fontstruct. Feel free to [head over to my page](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/154783/sketchbook_b) and download anything you like. Or better yet, sign up for an account and start experimenting.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/sbb-fontstruct.png\" alt=\"Examples of typefaces designed with Fontstruct\" title=\"sbb_fontstruct.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"1488\" />\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n[^1]: And was built in Flash!\n[^2]: Glyphs is my type design software of choice.

				"title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Chocolate Cake for Breakfast, and Gill Sans: Separating work from their creator?",
				"content_html": "<p>I watched a couple of my favorite episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer tonight. The show was once one of my favorites and creator <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon\">Joss Whedon</a> could do no wrong. I loved Buffy, Firefly, The Avengers and Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog. I even watched Agents of SHIELD. But eventually, it came to light that Joss wasn’t the feminist he claimed to be, repeatedly cheated on his wife, and verbally abused many of the people he worked with, especially Charisma Carpenter.</p>\n<p>Chocolate Cake for Breakfast is one of my favorite stand up routines. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby\">Bill Cosby’s</a> family-inspired standup — long before the Cosby Show — was hilarious. But later in life, he was credibly accused of drugging and sexually assaulting several women.</p>\n<p>Gill Sans is a legendary typeface, created by author, artist and typographer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill\">Eric Gill</a>. I’ve worked for several companies for which Gill Sans was a key element of their corporate visual identity. But Eric Gill noted in his diary that he had numerous affairs, sexually assaulted two of his daughters&hellip; and his dog.</p>\n<p>These are three examples, but they are far from the only examples. Many works of art and entertainment have been created by people who turn out to be despicable. How do you separate the creator from their work? Can you?</p>\n<p>For me, I can separate Joss Whedon from Buffy and his other creations. He didn’t write every word and the show isn’t just him. The actors, writers, and staff brought the show to life and crafted the characters who I loved so much. But I have to admit that I’m now less likely to watch old episodes of Buffy, and I no longer hold the show on the pedestal that I once did.</p>\n<p>It’s different for Bill Cosby and Eric Gill, though.

				"content_text": "I watched a couple of my favorite episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer tonight. The show was once one of my favorites and creator [Joss Whedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon) could do no wrong. I loved Buffy, Firefly, The Avengers and Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog. I even watched Agents of SHIELD. But eventually, it came to light that Joss wasn’t the feminist he claimed to be, repeatedly cheated on his wife, and verbally abused many of the people he worked with, especially Charisma Carpenter.\n\nChocolate Cake for Breakfast is one of my favorite stand up routines. [Bill Cosby’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby) family-inspired standup — long before the Cosby Show — was hilarious. But later in life, he was credibly accused of drugging and sexually assaulting several women.\n\nGill Sans is a legendary typeface, created by author, artist and typographer [Eric Gill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill). I’ve worked for several companies for which Gill Sans was a key element of their corporate visual identity. But Eric Gill noted in his diary that he had numerous affairs, sexually assaulted two of his daughters... and his dog.\n\nThese are three examples, but they are far from the only examples. Many works of art and entertainment have been created by people who turn out to be despicable. How do you separate the creator from their work? Can you?\n\nFor me, I can separate Joss Whedon from Buffy and his other creations. He didn’t write every word and the show isn’t just him. The actors, writers, and staff brought the show to life and crafted the characters who I loved so much. But I have to admit that I’m now less likely to watch old episodes of Buffy, and I no longer hold the show on the pedestal that I once did.\n\nIt’s different for Bill Cosby and Eric Gill, though. Their creations are sole creative endeavors. As much as I might like Cosby’s old standup routines or Gill Sans, I can’t separate the creation from the person who created it. I don’t listen to old Cosby standup, and I don’t share it with my kids. I don’t use Gill Sans (or any Eric Gill typefaces) if I can avoid it. If I cite some of Eric Gill’s writings on typography like [I did a couple of months ago](https://bobwertz.com/2024/03/30/inherent-indestructible-permanent.html), I include a comment that he was a horrible human being.[^1]\n\nI’m not 100% sure this dichotomy makes sense, treating collaborative works differently than sole creations, but it’s where I am right now.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n[^1]: I almost didn't post the article referencing Gill's quote, but his writings on the craftsmanship during the Industrial Revolution are incredibly relevant in today's generative AI world. \n",

VW is resurrecting the old Scout brand for a line of electric SUVs.[^1] But to my knowledge, Honda is the first company to create a version of their corporate logo especially for electric vehicles. As the transition to electric vehicles continues, it will be interesting to see how EV branding continues to shift and evolve.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n[^1]: Scout SUVs will be manufactured just north of my hometown – Columbia, South Carolina.\n",

				"title": "Milestone: My first published research paper is now online",
				"content_html": "<p>I’ve reached a big milestone in my academic career: my first published research paper.</p>\n<p><em>Brand new: How visual context shapes initial response to logos and corporate visual identity systems</em> has bene published in the Journal of Product and Brand Management. It’s available now online and will  eventually be assigned to an issue. If you have access to journal articles through a university or public library, <a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPBM-08-2022-4124/full/html\">you can access the article.</a></p>\n<p>If you can’t access the article, here’s the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a new logo is released, it does not have an established meaning in the mind of the viewer. As logos have become more highly scrutinized by consumers and critics, it has become more important to understand viewers’ initial response to logos. While other studies have researched the impact of aesthetic choices on viewer reaction to logos, this study aims to understand the effect of the surrounding visual identity system when a new logo is introduced. This study combines a content analysis of 335 posts on the logo review website <em>Brand New</em> with the voting data from their polls to understand how visual context correlates with a viewer’s initial response. Increased amounts of visual context correlate to an improved response from viewers. Different types of context that can be presented – from logo variations and environmental examples to videos and animation – have varied effects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, my study finds that people respond better to new logos when they are shown more examples of the logo in use. This is one of those things that seems intuitive to designers, but hasn’t been researched or quantified. Because I’m a designer, most people are surprised that my research includes a fair amount of statistical analysis, but I’ve really taken to the quantitive side of things. This paper has been in review for over a year, working it’s way through the revision process.</p>\n<p>It’s fitting that this is my first paper to be published. When I started grad school, I didn’t really know anything about scholarly research. In the spring of 2019 — my second semester as a grad student — I took a content analysis class with Carol Pardun. I was the only master’s level student in a class full of Ph.D. students. I felt so overwhelmed by the pressure to come up with an idea and learn methods and theories on the fly. The paper I wrote for that class was the first version of this paper. It was accepted to the AEJMC Conference that August and I presented in Toronto — my first academic conference presentation.

				"content_text": "I’ve reached a big milestone in my academic career: my first published research paper.\n\n_Brand new: How visual context shapes initial response to logos and corporate visual identity systems_ has bene published in the Journal of Product and Brand Management. It’s available now online and will  eventually be assigned to an issue. If you have access to journal articles through a university or public library, [you can access the article.](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPBM-08-2022-4124/full/html)\n\nIf you can’t access the article, here’s the abstract:\n\n> When a new logo is released, it does not have an established meaning in the mind of the viewer. As logos have become more highly scrutinized by consumers and critics, it has become more important to understand viewers’ initial response to logos. While other studies have researched the impact of aesthetic choices on viewer reaction to logos, this study aims to understand the effect of the surrounding visual identity system when a new logo is introduced. This study combines a content analysis of 335 posts on the logo review website _Brand New_ with the voting data from their polls to understand how visual context correlates with a viewer’s initial response. Increased amounts of visual context correlate to an improved response from viewers. Different types of context that can be presented – from logo variations and environmental examples to videos and animation – have varied effects.\n\nBasically, my study finds that people respond better to new logos when they are shown more examples of the logo in use. This is one of those things that seems intuitive to designers, but hasn’t been researched or quantified. Because I’m a designer, most people are surprised that my research includes a fair amount of statistical analysis, but I’ve really taken to the quantitive side of things. This paper has been in review for over a year, working it’s way through the revision process. \n\nIt’s fitting that this is my first paper to be published. When I started grad school, I didn’t really know anything about scholarly research. In the spring of 2019 — my second semester as a grad student — I took a content analysis class with Carol Pardun. I was the only master’s level student in a class full of Ph.D. students. I felt so overwhelmed by the pressure to come up with an idea and learn methods and theories on the fly. The paper I wrote for that class was the first version of this paper. It was accepted to the AEJMC Conference that August and I presented in Toronto — my first academic conference presentation. I loved the concept for the study and got great feedback, but I was still learning and felt like I could improve it. I scrapped everything, started over with a larger sample and better methodology. After Dr. Pardun retired, I started working with Tara Mortensen on the next evolution of this work, which turned into my thesis. And that thesis eventually became this paper.\n\nThanks go out to so many people who’ve help me along the way:\n* Dr. Pardun for supporting my bizarre little project, especially in the early days when the project was taking shape.\n* All of the Ph.D. students in that content analysis class who helped me figure things out and took me under their wing.\n* Dr. Mortensen for taking over as my thesis director and helping guide me through the publication process. \n* Kevin Hull and Van Kornegay for serving on my committee and providing helpful feedback.\n* Robert McKeever and Jacob Long for giving me an appropriate foundation for analyzing data. \n* Editor Cleopatra Veloutsou who guided me through the process with the _Journal of Product and Brand Management_.\n* All of the reviewers and discussants at the conference level for AEJMC and in the peer review process whose feedback legitimately made this paper better.\n\nAnd of course, this couldn’t have happened without the rest of Team Wertz. Liz and the kids have been so supportive and patient while I have embarked on this grad school journey. (And occasionally, Norah and Jill even joined me at Starbucks when I had to write.) I simply could not have done it without them.\n\nI’ve still got a few years left until I finish my classwork and dissertation, but I’m exceptionally proud of this milestone and excited to see where my research goes next.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n",

Given the high profile implosion of Twitter, and the bravado between Musk and Zuckerberg, I think pretty much every story is going to frame Instagram Threads as a Twitter-killer.\nI do imagine that they’ll at least mention Mastodon and Bluesky. Beyond that, who knows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"priming\">Priming</h3>\n<p>If the mass media covers the introduction of Threads – and the framing is positive – the coverage may be enough to prompt people to sign up for accounts. This priming effect is typically short-lived, but if Meta is able to get a lot of news coverage, there may be a surge in sign ups not too dissimilar to the surge in interest surrounding Mastodon and Bluesky. This won’t necessarily translate into engaged customers, but getting people to download the app and try the service is the first hurdle for Meta.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So as you look at the media coverage surrounding the launch of Instagram Threads, think about it in terms of agenda setting, framing and priming.

Given the high profile implosion of Twitter, and the bravado between Musk and Zuckerberg, I think pretty much every story is going to frame Instagram Threads as a Twitter-killer. \nI do imagine that they’ll at least mention Mastodon and Bluesky. Beyond that, who knows.\n\n### Priming  \nIf the mass media covers the introduction of Threads – and the framing is positive – the coverage may be enough to prompt people to sign up for accounts. This priming effect is typically short-lived, but if Meta is able to get a lot of news coverage, there may be a surge in sign ups not too dissimilar to the surge in interest surrounding Mastodon and Bluesky. This won’t necessarily translate into engaged customers, but getting people to download the app and try the service is the first hurdle for Meta. \n\n---\n\nSo as you look at the media coverage surrounding the launch of Instagram Threads, think about it in terms of agenda setting, framing and priming. (And actually, as you look at media bias in general, these three concepts are helpful in understanding how it works and why it happens.)\n\n---\n\n<em>Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.</em>\n\n[^1]: I’ve massively simplified things, so if one of my professors sees this… I’m sorry.\n\n[^2]: Unlike Twitter, Facebook actually has a public relations team. They should be able to round up some significant coverage.\n",

I curated and built my #Fav8 in [2018](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/12/27/fav8), [2019](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/12/14/fav-8-gt-best-9?rq=fav8), [2020](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2020/12/31/2020-fav8?rq=fav8) and [2021](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2021/12/28/2021-fav8?rq=fav8). If you are interested in learning more about the thought process behind Favorite 8, [the 2018 post](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/12/27/fav8) has the most detail.\n\nThis year, I’m not posting to Twitter, so I’m ditching the #Fav8 hashtag and just going with “Favorite 8.” Although on Micro.Blog, I’m thinking ❤️8️⃣ might be appropriate.\n\nIn the past, several friends have done this too, so this is just a reminder that it’s time to start working on selecting your Favorite 8 shots from 2022. I’ll probably post mine next week.\n\n",

I get additional articles and an extra podcast on Friday afternoons, but again, a way to support writers that I like.

				"title": "The Curious Case of the Missing Apple Logo",
				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"two-notable-logo-trends-from-apple\">Two notable logo trends from Apple</h2>\n<p><em>This post was originally posted on April 22, 2021 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>\n<p>Apple has one of the most recognizable logos in the world. Which isn’t surprising because they are the largest company in the world. I’ve been watching a couple of trends over the last few months about how Apple uses their logos and this week, those trends have become even more apparent. For brand managers and designers, I think there is something interesting going on and it’s worth digging into the mystery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-logo-is-missing\">The logo is “missing.”</h3>\n<p>Apple isn’t afraid to use their logos. All of their computers have prominent logos. They include logo stickers in all of their boxes. Apple’s logo is everywhere. But on their new iMac, which was released this week, Apple’s logo is on the back, but not on the front. The last few generations of iMac’s have featured a prominent logo on the back and a second logo on the “chin,” facing the user. The new iMac has no user facing logo.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But the iMac isn’t the only recent Apple product with an interesting logo story. I first noticed Apple’s changing logo use with the introduction of the AirPod Max, which has no Apple logos at all on the product. There is plenty of room for a logo on the side of the headphones, but there is none to be found.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I guessed the AirPods Max was the only Apple product without a logo, but I was wrong. For some reason I assumed that my AirPods case had the Apple logo on it, but guess what? It doesn’t. I checked Apple’s website and the AirPods Pro don’t have a logo either. (Although according to Apple’s website and an iFixit teardown, the chip inside the AirPods Pro has a tiny logo printed on it.) My Apple Watch has a tiny Apple logo on the bottom on it, but it’s not visible when it’s being worn. Apple doesn’t include logos on any of their wearable products.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But that’s not all. I’ve been trying out Apple Fitness+ and there are tons of visible logos. Nike logos. All of the instructors seem to be wearing Nike gear. There are no Apple logos. No special Apple Fitness+ shirts. No little Apple “watermark” in the corner of the screen. An Apple logo isn’t hidden somewhere on the set.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I checked Apple’s competitors. Amazon, Samsung and Microsoft all include their logo on the charging case for their AirPod competitors. Sony and Google even managed to get their logo on the earbud itself. None of the competing smartwatches that I looked at had logos, although Samsung etched “Galaxy Watch” into the crown for some reason.</p>\n<p>In the fitness space, Peloton employees sport logo apparel while they lead classes. And the instructors on Nike’s fitness apps obviously sport Nike gear.</p>\n<p>So what’s going on? I’m not sure.</p>\n<p>My first reaction is it’s just an issue of taste. Placing logos all over a product is tacky — especially for wearables. And Apple is showing their superior taste by acknowledging that consumers don’t always want to be sporting company logos. Maybe? But lots of premium and luxury brands include logos on their products. And Apple isn’t exactly shy about using their logo.</p>\n<p>It’s not about the logo size. Even the Apple Pencil has a logo. And as I mentioned, the chips inside the AirPods have logos printed on them. (The chips… inside the case… that the consumer never sees…)</p>\n<p>The absence of a logo is even stranger when you realize the original intent of a trademarked logo: to clearly identify the manufacturer. With a company like Apple, whose designs are ripped off more than about any other tech company, their logo is the part of the design that absolutely can’t be legally copied.</p>\n<p>My best guess is that Apple thinks that their product designs are unique enough, that they don’t even need a logo. People will know AirPods are an Apple product when they see them. The Apple Fitness+ workouts feel like Apple even if their logo isn’t present. I don’t think any other company can make a desktop computer that looks like the new iMac. Apple’s presence is understood because of the overall production quality and design. A logo isn’t necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-logo-is-incognito\">The logo is “incognito.”</h3>\n<p>Typical corporate logo standards are incredibly strict. Apple doesn’t publish their internal brand guidelines, but it’s clear they do allow some more playful uses of their mark. For example, they often use illustrated versions of their logo to promote their media events, like they did for this week’s Spring Forward event. Allowing logo variations in large corporate identity systems isn’t uncommon, but those variations are typically used for structural identifications between organizational divisions or product lines.</p>\n<p>But Apple is using logo variants that align with their values.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In 2014, Apple started using a logo with a green leaf in their retail stores on Earth Day. This logo seems to be used mostly in Apple retail, but showed up this week on the Apple home page for Earth Day 2021 and their updated environmental statement.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And in this week’s presentation, they showed their privacy Apple variation, which is often animated and turns the leaf at the top of their logo into a lock. It’s used in ads, videos and sites when Apple is talking about their commitment to privacy. What’s smart about this approach is that Apple is using their logo to not just communicate their identity, but also their corporate values.</p>\n<p>(It’s worth noting that there are a couple of other logo variants as well: a gift that is used during the holidays and a version for their Marina Bay Sands retail store in Singapore. And I’m sure there are others as well.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-lessons-can-we-take-from-apples-approach-to-logo-management\">What lessons can we take from Apple’s approach to logo management?</h3>\n<p>Apple’s visual branding is clearly effective. Repetition and consistency are the foundation of contemporary brand management, but Apple has decided to not use their logo in some places and change it in others. This ongoing shift in logo usage isn’t accidental or ill-considered. A couple of lessons to think about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Everything doesn’t need a logo.</strong> In the 1990s, branding meant putting the logo on everything, but is it really necessary? (It isn’t.) Logos are important, but they aren’t the only way you communicate your identity. Apple’s using their logos smartly, and not over using their marks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Differentiation happens with the design around the logo.</strong> Apple’s products are identified by their look and feel. Yes, the logo is part of that, but Apple’s visual branding extends far beyond just their logo. Their brand is expressed as much through the surrounding elements — type, color, materials — as it is through their logo. Their visual differentiation extends far beyond just their logo and their identity is stronger for it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Think about how a visual identity can reflect a company’s values.</strong> Most of the time, visual identity reflects an organization’s structure, but connecting your visual brand to your corporate values is potentially more powerful. Apple uses logo variations that support their beliefs, not their hierarchy.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’ll never hear from their branding team and Apple doesn’t publicly share their logo and branding guidelines. We’ll just have to watch as they rollout ads, events and products. But it’s clear that Apple is diverging from the standard brand playbook here and I think we should pay attention to where they go next.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

The new iMac has no user facing logo.[^1]\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/6fac39931b.jpg\" alt=\"Apple's New iMacs\" title=\"apple_new-imac-spring21_hero_04202021.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" />\n\n<figcaption>The new iMac doesn’t have a logo on the front, but still sports a prominent mark on the back.</figcaption> \n</figure>\n\n\nBut the iMac isn’t the only recent Apple product with an interesting logo story. I first noticed Apple’s changing logo use with the introduction of the AirPod Max, which has no Apple logos at all on the product. There is plenty of room for a logo on the side of the headphones, but there is none to be found.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/apple-airpods-max-color-blue-white-bkgd.jpg\" alt=\"Apple airpods-max color-blue white bkgd.\" title=\"apple_airpods-max_color-blue_white_bkgd.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n<figcaption>A large space for a logo… but there isn’t one.</figcaption> \n</figure>\n\nI guessed the AirPods Max was the only Apple product without a logo, but I was wrong. For some reason I assumed that my AirPods case had the Apple logo on it, but guess what? It doesn’t. I checked Apple’s website and the AirPods Pro don’t have a logo either. (Although according to Apple’s website and an iFixit teardown, the chip inside the AirPods Pro has a tiny logo printed on it.) My Apple Watch has a tiny Apple logo on the bottom on it, but it’s not visible when it’s being worn. Apple doesn’t include logos on any of their wearable products.[^2]\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/apple-fitnessplus-lifestyle-trainers-12142020.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Fitness Plus trainers\" title=\"Apple_FitnessPlus-lifestyle-trainers_12142020.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" >\n<figcaption>A promotional image from Apple of Apple Fitness+ trainers. I count five Nike logos.</figcaption> \n</figure>\n\nBut that’s not all. I’ve been trying out Apple Fitness+ and there are tons of visible logos. Nike logos. All of the instructors seem to be wearing Nike gear. There are no Apple logos. No special Apple Fitness+ shirts. No little Apple “watermark” in the corner of the screen. An Apple logo isn’t hidden somewhere on the set.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/airpod-competitors.jpg\" alt=\"Airpod competitors.\" title=\"airpod_competitors.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n<figcaption>AirPod competitors, with prominent logos on the case or the earbud itself.</figcaption> \n</figure>\n\nI checked Apple’s competitors. Amazon, Samsung and Microsoft all include their logo on the charging case for their AirPod competitors. Sony and Google even managed to get their logo on the earbud itself. None of the competing smartwatches that I looked at had logos, although Samsung etched “Galaxy Watch” into the crown for some reason.\n\nIn the fitness space, Peloton employees sport logo apparel while they lead classes. And the instructors on Nike’s fitness apps obviously sport Nike gear.\n\nSo what’s going on? I’m not sure.\n\nMy first reaction is it’s just an issue of taste. Placing logos all over a product is tacky — especially for wearables. And Apple is showing their superior taste by acknowledging that consumers don’t always want to be sporting company logos. Maybe? But lots of premium and luxury brands include logos on their products. And Apple isn’t exactly shy about using their logo.\n\nIt’s not about the logo size. Even the Apple Pencil has a logo. And as I mentioned, the chips inside the AirPods have logos printed on them. (The chips… inside the case… that the consumer never sees…)\n\nThe absence of a logo is even stranger when you realize the original intent of a trademarked logo: to clearly identify the manufacturer. With a company like Apple, whose designs are ripped off more than about any other tech company, their logo is the part of the design that absolutely can’t be legally copied. \n\nMy best guess is that Apple thinks that their product designs are unique enough, that they don’t even need a logo. People will know AirPods are an Apple product when they see them. The Apple Fitness+ workouts feel like Apple even if their logo isn’t present. I don’t think any other company can make a desktop computer that looks like the new iMac. Apple’s presence is understood because of the overall production quality and design. A logo isn’t necessary.\n\n### The logo is “incognito.”\n\nTypical corporate logo standards are incredibly strict. Apple doesn’t publish their internal brand guidelines, but it’s clear they do allow some more playful uses of their mark. For example, they often use illustrated versions of their logo to promote their media events, like they did for this week’s Spring Forward event. Allowing logo variations in large corporate identity systems isn’t uncommon, but those variations are typically used for structural identifications between organizational divisions or product lines. \n\nBut Apple is using logo variants that align with their values.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/earth-day-homepage-graphic-2.jpg\" alt=\"Earth day homepage graphic\" title=\"earth_day_homepage_graphic-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"132\" />\n<figcaption>Apple’s environmental logo version, on Earth Day.\n</figcaption> \n</figure>\n\nIn 2014, Apple started using a logo with a green leaf in their retail stores on Earth Day. This logo seems to be used mostly in Apple retail, but showed up this week on the Apple home page for Earth Day 2021 and their updated environmental statement.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/apple-privacy-day-privacy-logo-01282021-big.jpg.large-2x-2.jpg\" alt=\"Apple privacy-day privacy-logo\" title=\"apple_privacy-day_privacy-logo_01282021_big.jpg.large_2x-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\"/>\n<figcaption>Apple’s Privacy logo version is probably the most used of their variations.</figcaption> \n</figure>\n\nAnd in this week’s presentation, they showed their privacy Apple variation, which is often animated and turns the leaf at the top of their logo into a lock. It’s used in ads, videos and sites when Apple is talking about their commitment to privacy. What’s smart about this approach is that Apple is using their logo to not just communicate their identity, but also their corporate values.\n\n(It’s worth noting that there are a couple of other logo variants as well: a gift that is used during the holidays and a version for their Marina Bay Sands retail store in Singapore. And I’m sure there are others as well.)\n\n### What lessons can we take from Apple’s approach to logo management?\n\nApple’s visual branding is clearly effective. Repetition and consistency are the foundation of contemporary brand management, but Apple has decided to not use their logo in some places and change it in others. This ongoing shift in logo usage isn’t accidental or ill-considered. A couple of lessons to think about:\n\n1. **Everything doesn’t need a logo.** In the 1990s, branding meant putting the logo on everything, but is it really necessary? (It isn’t.) Logos are important, but they aren’t the only way you communicate your identity. Apple’s using their logos smartly, and not over using their marks.\n\n2. **Differentiation happens with the design around the logo.** Apple’s products are identified by their look and feel. Yes, the logo is part of that, but Apple’s visual branding extends far beyond just their logo. Their brand is expressed as much through the surrounding elements — type, color, materials — as it is through their logo. Their visual differentiation extends far beyond just their logo and their identity is stronger for it.\n\n3. **Think about how a visual identity can reflect a company’s values.** Most of the time, visual identity reflects an organization’s structure, but connecting your visual brand to your corporate values is potentially more powerful. Apple uses logo variations that support their beliefs, not their hierarchy.\n\nWe’ll never hear from their branding team and Apple doesn’t publicly share their logo and branding guidelines. We’ll just have to watch as they rollout ads, events and products. But it’s clear that Apple is diverging from the standard brand playbook here and I think we should pay attention to where they go next.\n\n---\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

Because I scored a high enough score on my AP Calculus test, I was able to exempt all of my college math requirements, so I haven’t taken a math class in almost 25 years. What I’ve come to realize is that while I disliked the way I was taught math, math itself is pretty amazing. And useful. \n\nDon’t misunderstand me… I’m not expecting designers to line up and take refresher math classes. AIGA chapters aren’t going to start holding day-long math workshops. All I’m saying is that embracing the idea that math is an integral part of design only helps the profession as a whole.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

				"content_html": "<p><em>This post was originally posted on November 13, 2015 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>\n<p>I get asked a lot what it’s like to have three kids. Mostly from people with two kids thinking about whether they want to have another. Sometimes, the question comes from younger couples who are thinking about having kids.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> And I always struggle to answer.</p>\n<p>My standard answer is that when you have three kids, you have to switch from man-to-man to zone. You lose a little control. You are outnumbered. And while that is completely accurate, it sounds scary and intimidating, which isn’t at all what I want to communicate. I love having three kids.</p>\n<p>My other answer is that with three kids, how far apart they are really matters. I’ve had friends with three kids under four years old. For us, our oldest was seven when her brother was born. Those are two radically different situations. But that doesn&rsquo;t really answer the question.</p>\n<p>Sunday morning, an interaction with the kids gave me the answer I was missing. We were waking up and getting ready for church.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Middle child:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> What are we doing for breakfast?</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Me:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I don’t know. We’ll probably have a small breakfast now and maybe go to brunch after church.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Youngest:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> WHAT! We can’t go to a restaurant!

It's reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site._\n\nI get asked a lot what it’s like to have three kids. Mostly from people with two kids thinking about whether they want to have another. Sometimes, the question comes from younger couples who are thinking about having kids.[^1] And I always struggle to answer.\n\nMy standard answer is that when you have three kids, you have to switch from man-to-man to zone. You lose a little control. You are outnumbered. And while that is completely accurate, it sounds scary and intimidating, which isn’t at all what I want to communicate. I love having three kids.\n\nMy other answer is that with three kids, how far apart they are really matters. I’ve had friends with three kids under four years old. For us, our oldest was seven when her brother was born. Those are two radically different situations. But that doesn't really answer the question.\n\nSunday morning, an interaction with the kids gave me the answer I was missing. We were waking up and getting ready for church.\n\n<strong>Middle child:</strong> What are we doing for breakfast?\n\n<strong>Me:</strong> I don’t know. We’ll probably have a small breakfast now and maybe go to brunch after church.\n\n<strong>Youngest:</strong> WHAT! We can’t go to a restaurant! We need to go to church! (He LOVES Sunday School.)\n\n<strong>Me:</strong> We are going to church. We might go out to eat after church.\n\n<strong>Youngest: </strong>Why can’t we eat at church?\n\n<strong>Me: </strong>Because they aren’t serving breakfast at church.[^2]\n\n<strong>Oldest (from another room):</strong> We’re having breakfast at church?!?\n\nAnd that’s what it’s like having three kids — like adding a person to a game of telephone. It gets a little bit crazier. Funnier. Unpredictable. Often delightful and occasionally frustrating. But never boring.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>\n<p>One of the defining design characteristics of a ship in the Star Trek Universe is the forward viewscreen. And in the J.J. Abrams reboot of Star Trek, the entire concept of the viewscreen has also been reimagined.</p>\n<p>By looking at how our vision of the future has evolved, we can often learn more about how we as a society have changed. And I think by looking at how the concept of the viewscreen has changed over the last four decades, I think we can draw some conclusions about how we have changed as culture and where we are going.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"the-original-viewscreen\">The Original Viewscreen</h2>\n<p>In Gene Roddenberry’s original Star Trek TV Show, the view screen was primarily a giant screen showing the outside. Very rarely, the screen would be used to show scientific data.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>At the time, in the late 60’s, that concept was enough to seem futuristic. TV’s were still a relatively young technology. A screen that size providing live pictures with the ability to show content from the ship’s computer… That was the future. Computers were room-sized devices with limited capabilities. The whole concept would have seemed very advanced.</p>\n<p>The expectation was that interaction with a large viewscreen would be passive. It was something to watch, more like a TV than a computer interface.</p>\n<h2 id=\"to-the-big-screen-and-back-to-the-small-screen\">To the big screen and back to the small screen</h2>\n<p>When the Star Trek series moved to the big screen in the late 70’s and into the 80’s, the viewscreen concept was only slightly refined. The expectation was still that the viewscreen provided a passive experience.

				"content_text": "_This post was originally posted on June 1, 2009 on Sketchbook B. It's reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site._\n\nOne of the defining design characteristics of a ship in the Star Trek Universe is the forward viewscreen. And in the J.J. Abrams reboot of Star Trek, the entire concept of the viewscreen has also been reimagined.\n\nBy looking at how our vision of the future has evolved, we can often learn more about how we as a society have changed. And I think by looking at how the concept of the viewscreen has changed over the last four decades, I think we can draw some conclusions about how we have changed as culture and where we are going.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/1895869-3235379-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The new Enterprise viewscreen display various data, including speed.\" title=\"1895869-3235379-thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"204\" />\n<figcaption>The new Enterprise viewscreen display various data, including speed.

Copyright Paramount/CBS.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## The Original Viewscreen\n\nIn Gene Roddenberry’s original Star Trek TV Show, the view screen was primarily a giant screen showing the outside. Very rarely, the screen would be used to show scientific data.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/1895869-3235383-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"1895869 3235383 thumbnail.\" title=\"A rare instance of the original Enterprise using its viewscreen to display data from the ship’s computer.\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"299\" />\n<figcaption>A rare instance of the original Enterprise using its viewscreen to display data from the ship’s computer. Image via Memory Alpha. Copyright Paramount/CBS.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAt the time, in the late 60’s, that concept was enough to seem futuristic. TV’s were still a relatively young technology. A screen that size providing live pictures with the ability to show content from the ship’s computer… That was the future. Computers were room-sized devices with limited capabilities. The whole concept would have seemed very advanced.\n\nThe expectation was that interaction with a large viewscreen would be passive. It was something to watch, more like a TV than a computer interface.\n\n## To the big screen and back to the small screen\n\nWhen the Star Trek series moved to the big screen in the late 70’s and into the 80’s, the viewscreen concept was only slightly refined. The expectation was still that the viewscreen provided a passive experience. Some odd touches were added, like a digital clock over the screen.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2024/iks-kronos-one-on-viewscreen.jpg\" alt=\"IKS Kronos One on viewscreen.\" title=\"IKS_Kronos_One_on_viewscreen.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"303\" />\n<figcaption>Nothing says the future like a digital alarm clock.
