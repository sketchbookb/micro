The Adobe Firefly site lists one feature as coming soon, Recolor Vectors. I’m not sure how that will differ from the Recolor Artwork feature in Adobe Illustrator, but I’m looking forward to trying it out. Several other features are teased as “In exploration” and some of them look interesting. No idea how close to release these are — for all I know, they are ideas on a white board — but “text to vector” and “extend background” could be fun to play with. I’ll likely write additional posts as new features are introduced.\n\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n",

In the screenshot below, I used the \"Post Length\" setting.\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2023/bcb409869f.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the category filter.\" title=\"postfilter.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"255\" />    \n\n3. **Determine the URL for each category.** Each category in Micro.Blog has a URL, typically formatted as `http://DOMAIN-NAME/categories/CATEGORY-NAME.` Find the URLs for each of the categories you want in the navigation.\n\n4. **Create a new page.** Name the page and then paste the category URL into the content box.  Make sure “Include this page in your blog navigation” is checked. Repeat for all of your categories. You’ll then have a navigation item for each of your categories. \n\nThis technique works really well when paired with the Custom Home Page plug in. You can see the result in the navigation [on my site.](http://www.bobwertz.com) I know that I could do this by building a custom template. At some point, maybe I will. But right now, I'd like to keep it as simple as I can, and this works really well for me.\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n",

So I figured I'd go with superscript numbers, which is more conventional anyway.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; I continue to use divider lines to separate the body of the post from the footnotes, and a second divider line between the footnotes and a bio.\n\nI'm not sure what I want to do with the bio. I found that most of my traffic came from Google, so the reader was dropping in on my site with no idea who I was. For now, I've decided to go with the shortest one sentence bio that I could and set it at the end in italics.\n\nOne aspect that I haven't yet decided on is images. On my Squarespace-hosted site, each post had a preview image and I'd include a post image. So far on bobwertz.com, I don't need a preview image, but I do think I want to create some type of standard post image to include under the subhead. I'll keep experimenting, but I feel good about my basic post format.\n\n--- \n\n1. I'm going to keep writing at Sketchbook B, but the content will be mostly Adobe Creative Cloud tips.\n2. I'm using a trial of MarsEdit right now. And I really love the preview engine that lets me see how this is going to look, even before I post it. Looks like I'll be purchasing a license.\n3. I don't love how the superscripts mess with the overall line spacing. It just feels wrong. I may try to come up with another approach.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n",

				"title": "Twitterless, Part III",
				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"preparing-for-a-future-without-twitter\">Preparing for a future without Twitter.</h2>\n<p>I’ve been preparing for the demise of Twitter since long before Elon Musk made the offer to purchase it. In 2016, I wrote a post — <a href=\"https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2016/11/9/twitterless\">Twitterless</a> — about what would happen if Twitter “disappeared tomorrow.” I outlined a couple of key areas that would be problematic for me and possible solutions.</p>\n<p>A year and a half later, I wrote a follow up post — <a href=\"https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/3/twitterless-part-ii?rq=twitterless\">Twitterless, Part II</a> — that noted my progress on replacing the role Twitter plays for me, and the challenges that still existed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Times are changing, though, and I honestly believe that we all need to be diversifying — and if possible, owning — our social media presence. Becoming less reliant on the big social media behemoths is the first step.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I ended that post with a promise to follow up on my progress, but as Facebook became more and more evil, I focused <a href=\"https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/6/22/another-why-i-am-quitting-facebook-post?rq=facebook\">on moving away from Facebook.</a> Replacing Twitter was pushed to the back burner.</p>\n<p>Now that Twitter armageddon may or may not be here, it’s clearly time that I renew my quest to find an alternative. I figured I’d check back in on those questions that I asked back in 2016 and see how I’ve done:</p>\n<p><strong>I’d lose a bunch of contacts.</strong> Yep. I’m going to lose a bunch of people who follow me on Twitter. I’ve tried to connect with people on other platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram, but I can’t find everyone, and you know what, I’m okay with that.</p>\n<p><strong>I’d change how I watch live events.</strong> This is still a problem as <a href=\"https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/06/live-events-and.html\">I noted yesterday.</a> Live events are fun to follow with other people, and Twitter is great for that. No other service is quite like Twitter for those instant commentary events.</p>\n<p><strong>I’d have to rethink how I find articles and stories.</strong> I use <a href=\"http://www.feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a> as an RSS reader, but that’s not my only solution. I subscribe directly to <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post.</em> And — as shocking as it might seem — I also get a lot of value out of Apple News+, which I get with our Apple One bundle.

				"content_text": "## Preparing for a future without Twitter.\n\nI’ve been preparing for the demise of Twitter since long before Elon Musk made the offer to purchase it. In 2016, I wrote a post — [Twitterless](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2016/11/9/twitterless) — about what would happen if Twitter “disappeared tomorrow.” I outlined a couple of key areas that would be problematic for me and possible solutions.\n\nA year and a half later, I wrote a follow up post — [Twitterless, Part II](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/3/twitterless-part-ii?rq=twitterless) — that noted my progress on replacing the role Twitter plays for me, and the challenges that still existed.\n\n> Times are changing, though, and I honestly believe that we all need to be diversifying — and if possible, owning — our social media presence. Becoming less reliant on the big social media behemoths is the first step.\n\nI ended that post with a promise to follow up on my progress, but as Facebook became more and more evil, I focused [on moving away from Facebook.](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/6/22/another-why-i-am-quitting-facebook-post?rq=facebook) Replacing Twitter was pushed to the back burner.\n\nNow that Twitter armageddon may or may not be here, it’s clearly time that I renew my quest to find an alternative. I figured I’d check back in on those questions that I asked back in 2016 and see how I’ve done:\n\n**I’d lose a bunch of contacts.** Yep. I’m going to lose a bunch of people who follow me on Twitter. I’ve tried to connect with people on other platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram, but I can’t find everyone, and you know what, I’m okay with that. \n\n**I’d change how I watch live events.** This is still a problem as [I noted yesterday.](https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/06/live-events-and.html) Live events are fun to follow with other people, and Twitter is great for that. No other service is quite like Twitter for those instant commentary events.\n\n**I’d have to rethink how I find articles and stories.** I use [Feedbin](http://www.feedbin.com) as an RSS reader, but that’s not my only solution. I subscribe directly to _The New York Times_ and _The Washington Post._ And — as shocking as it might seem — I also get a lot of value out of Apple News+, which I get with our Apple One bundle. My local paper, _The State_, is included in with Apple News+ and I catch a random assortment of articles from sources I don’t normally read. It’s a nice way to diversify the news I see every day.\n\n**I’d have to rethink how I share content.** When I wrote this, I felt like traffic to my blog was coming primarily from Twitter, but over time, that lessened and most come through search engines. I’ll still create and share, but I’ll just use whatever channels are available at the time.\n\n**I’d change the way I use Facebook/Instagram.** I once thought that Facebook and Instagram might provide a solution. I’ve mostly left Facebook, and Meta seems to only care about the Metaverse now anyway. I’m not that interested in Instagram now that it’s trying to be TikTok. I don’t feel any better about Facebook than I do about Twitter.\n\n**I’d try to find a replacement.** I backed the [Micro.Blog Kickstarter]([https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing]) back in 2017 and I’ve had a paid account ever since. I originally [connected Micro.Blog to my Squarespace site](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/17/microblog-and-squarespace), which worked well over the years. I believe in the idea of a feed-based, open social media platform, but because I was still using Twitter, I didn’t fully commit to using Micro.Blog. \n\nI’ve still got [Sketchbook B](http://www.sketchbookb.com) and it’s still hosted on Squarespace, but I made the decision this summer that all of my future blog and short-form posting will be hosted on Micro.Blog, specifically, [bobwertz.com](http://www.bobwertz.com).
