I got to see the Cubs beat the Royals 6-0 in a game that included a little bit of everything including Suzuki stealing home.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/img-5314-15-edited-2.jpg\" alt=\"Marque at Wrigley\" title=\"IMG_5314 15 Edited 2.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/img-5317-16-edited-2.jpg\" alt=\"Bob and Liz with the Cubs' World Series trophy.\" title=\"IMG_5317 16 Edited 2.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/img-5318-17-edited-2.jpg\" alt=\"A daytime view of Wrigley behind home plate.\" title=\"IMG_5318 17 Edited 2.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/img-5329-18-edited-2.jpg\" alt=\"A mighttime view of Wrigley behind home plate.\" title=\"IMG_5329 18 Edited 2.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/img-5332-19-edited-2.jpg\" alt=\"Cubs Win on an LED sign\" title=\"IMG_5332 19 Edited 2.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n\nTo break up the trip on the way back, we stopped in Lexington, Kentucky and had an amazing dinner at Dudley's on Short.

Really thankful for Apple Maps, which made some time-saving route recommendations. The kids had a great time at camp. And we're finally back home.\n\nNext week, we celebrate my 50th birthday for real, but this experience was exactly what I wanted.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

Last year, I drove up to a Bojangles drive-thru in downtown Columbia, South Carolina and was greeted by a computerized voice.

I’d stop there occasionally to grab breakfast after dropping her off.

Would you like to upgrade to our new flavored iced tea?” At one point in Chapin, I counted five upgrade or add-on suggestions. I just had to keep telling it no.

I found a shot I took from our balcony in 2013 with a iPhone:[^1]\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/img-6854.jpg\" alt=\"View of a church steeple from a hotel in Charleston, SC.\" title=\"IMG_6854.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n\nWe weren’t the only one who loved the hotel. The French Quarter Inn was honored as one of the best in America by Travel and Leisure. After they were honored, it was tough to get a reservation and the prices increased dramatically. We moved on to other places that we loved, too.[^2] While it was disappointing to get priced out of one of our favorite places, honestly, the experience was so great, I’m just glad we had a number of years to enjoy it.\n\n[This week, they were selected as the best hotel in America by TripAdvisor and #8 internationally.](https://www.thestate.com/news/state/article306249681.html?tbref=hp) If you are looking to stay in Charleston and it’s in your budget, stay at the French Quarter Inn. It’s a wonderful experience and worth every penny.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

				"content_html": "<p>About 16 years ago, I started playing around with <a href=\"https://fontstruct.com\">Fontstruct</a>, an online tool for crafting modular typefaces. I’ve released <a href=\"https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/154783/sketchbook_b\">48 designs</a> on Fontstruct and some of those have served as prototypes for designs that I finish in <a href=\"https://glyphsapp.com\">Glyphs</a>, my favorite type design app. I tend to work in Fontstruct intensively for a while, and then disappear for a year or more. But I love the tool and contribute as a “Patron.”</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been on quite the streak.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2646363/sbb-papaya\">SbB Papaya.</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> I was watching F1 and McLaren uses some modular numerals on their cars. Based on those numbers, I built an entire design. I wasn’t sure if the look was going to extend through the whole character set, but the design actually works pretty well. And as a bonus, the Fontstruct team selected it as a top pick.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2661155/sbb-powercore\">SbB Powercore.</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> I’ve had some drawings in my sketchbook of a unicase design that I like a lot, but haven’t gotten around to building. I wanted to see how the letterforms would work together so I built a quick pixel-font prototype.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2663592/sbb-astrometric\">SbB Astrometric.</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> I took the basic letterform structure of Powercore and tried different approach. I thought this would look vaguely sci-fi when I started to build it, but as I built out the character set, it had a somewhat older feel. Not sure why. I’m really happy with it and this is one of those fonts that I’ll likely rebuild and polish in Glyphs. I think the design would work well as a variable font design.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href=\"https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2139708/sbb-theorem\">SbB Theorem.</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> I built this a few years ago, and forgot about it.

It’s a feature that’s available for Patrons. I’d played with it once before to add some color to my <a href=\"https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2395910/dingbots-and-monsters-color-xl\">Dingbots and Monsters</a> design, but I hadn’t tried to build a color typeface. I built SbB Greenlight to experiment with the process of building a color design. I’m still not 100% sure why we need color fonts, but it’s a fun process and a pretty accessible tool for anyone that’s worked with design software like Illustrator or Photoshop that use layers to organize art.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>You can download and use any of these<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> if you set up a free Fontstruct account.

				"content_text": "About 16 years ago, I started playing around with [Fontstruct](https://fontstruct.com), an online tool for crafting modular typefaces. I’ve released [48 designs](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/154783/sketchbook_b) on Fontstruct and some of those have served as prototypes for designs that I finish in [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com), my favorite type design app. I tend to work in Fontstruct intensively for a while, and then disappear for a year or more. But I love the tool and contribute as a “Patron.”\n\nLately, I’ve been on quite the streak.\n\n<strong>[SbB Papaya.](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2646363/sbb-papaya)</strong> I was watching F1 and McLaren uses some modular numerals on their cars. Based on those numbers, I built an entire design. I wasn’t sure if the look was going to extend through the whole character set, but the design actually works pretty well. And as a bonus, the Fontstruct team selected it as a top pick.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/papaya.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Papaya.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n\n<strong>[SbB Powercore.](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2661155/sbb-powercore)</strong> I’ve had some drawings in my sketchbook of a unicase design that I like a lot, but haven’t gotten around to building. I wanted to see how the letterforms would work together so I built a quick pixel-font prototype. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/powercore.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Powercore.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n\n<strong>[SbB Astrometric.](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2663592/sbb-astrometric)</strong> I took the basic letterform structure of Powercore and tried different approach. I thought this would look vaguely sci-fi when I started to build it, but as I built out the character set, it had a somewhat older feel. Not sure why. I’m really happy with it and this is one of those fonts that I’ll likely rebuild and polish in Glyphs. I think the design would work well as a variable font design.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/astrometric.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Astrometric.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n\n<strong>[SbB Theorem.](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2139708/sbb-theorem)</strong> I built this a few years ago, and forgot about it. So I dusted it off and added a few additional characters that I skipped over earlier.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/theorem.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"theorem.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n\n<strong>[SbB Greenlight.](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2666303/sbb-greenlight-color)</strong> All the cool kids are building color fonts on Fontstruct. It’s a feature that’s available for Patrons. I’d played with it once before to add some color to my [Dingbots and Monsters](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2395910/dingbots-and-monsters-color-xl) design, but I hadn’t tried to build a color typeface. I built SbB Greenlight to experiment with the process of building a color design. I’m still not 100% sure why we need color fonts, but it’s a fun process and a pretty accessible tool for anyone that’s worked with design software like Illustrator or Photoshop that use layers to organize art.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2025/greenlight.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"greenlight.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n\nYou can download and use any of these[^1] if you set up a free Fontstruct account. I don't know if I'll keep up the pace, but I'm really enjoying building typefaces right now and I'm inspired by the other designers in the Fontstruct community.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

				"title": "Five lectures",
				"content_html": "<p>I mentioned <a href=\"https://bobwertz.com/2025/02/25/eight-years-ago-today-i.html\">earlier this week</a> that the Edward Tufte workshop in Atlanta eight years ago was a driving factor in returning to graduate school, but that’s actually a partial truth. There were actually <em>five</em> lectures that sparked an interest in design research and grad school. All of them held in vast hotel meeting rooms with hundreds of attendees, but each of them connecting with me on a deeper level.</p>\n<p><strong>Jonah Lehrer, AIGA Gain Conference, October 2008, New York City</strong></p>\n<p>Gain was AIGA’s &ldquo;Business of Design&rdquo; conference<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> and there was a roster of big wig, influential speakers. Jonah Lehrer was there to talk about his best-selling book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Proust-Was-Neuroscientist-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/0547085907\">Proust was a Neuroscientist</a>. Lehrer connected creativity with neuroscience advancements, arguing that artists often figured out how the brain worked before scientists did. This concept that neuroscience and creativity could be linked was fascinating to me. A few years after this talk, Lehrer was found to have plagiarized and fabricated quotes in his later works, making this a strange choice to start my list, but after his talk, I started to think about design work a little differently. <a href=\"https://www.aiga.org/inspiration/talks/jonah-lehrer-2008-gain-conference\">There is a recording of the talk, but sadly, no audio for some reason.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Malcolm Gladwell, AIGA Gain Conference, October 2008, New York City</strong></p>\n<p>Same conference as Jonah Lehrer, but one day later. Malcolm Gladwell spoke about his forthcoming book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930\">Outliers</a>. People often criticize Gladwell for oversimplifying the research he builds on, but in that moment — combined with the Lehrer speech the day before — I could see connections between social sciences and design. I read Outliers afterwards and really enjoyed it, but could honestly never really get into Gladwell’s other work. <a href=\"https://www.aiga.org/inspiration/talks/malcolm-gladwell-2008-gain-conference\">Hidden somewhere on the AIGA servers is a complete recording of the lecture.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Larson, Typecon, July 2009, Atlanta</strong></p>\n<p>I loved Typecon Atlanta. Looking back at my notes and blog posts, I wrote about the inspiring speakers, the networking and the creative exploration of letterpress and hand lettering. I did not specifically note a lecture by Kevin Larson, which is really funny, because that’s the one that ended up being most influential for me. Larson is research scientist working for Microsoft and I remember his talk about the science of readability. How does the human brain process letterforms? And then form words and meaning? His general idea was that designers think they understand how readability works, but research shows that other factors are involved and room for improvement. There isn’t a recording around that I’m aware of, but I did find a <a href=\"https://atypi.org/presentation/designing-with-science/\">2013 talk with Larson and legendary designer Matthew Carter discussing collaborating on the design of a typeface</a> using letter recognition testing. Like the Lehrer and Gladwell talks, the idea of using science to better understand type design was exciting to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Edward Tufte, Presenting Data and Information, February 2017, Atlanta</strong></p>\n<p>In 2017<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, I was becoming interested in how information is structured and I’d read a little bit about Edward Tufte’s work. I drove down to Atlanta for a one-day workshop, expecting to learn how to design better presentations. In actuality, I left pondering the difference between designing to persuade and designing to inform. Too often, we don’t try to communicate information and let viewers come to their own conclusions. Instead, when we make presentations, we’ve already drawn conclusions and are trying to persuade people that those conclusions are correct. After the lecture wrapped up, I hopped on I-20 for the normally a 3.5 hour drive. That night, however, it was a 6 hour drive because of an accident on a bridge on the interstate. I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted out of my career.</p>\n<p><strong>Khoi Vinh, AIGA Leadership Retreat, June 2017, Dallas</strong></p>\n<p>The AIGA Leadership Retreat is a strange event. Part conference, part pep-rally, part-training… chapter board members from all over the United States converge on a conference hotel in a random AIGA city.

				"content_text": "I mentioned [earlier this week](https://bobwertz.com/2025/02/25/eight-years-ago-today-i.html) that the Edward Tufte workshop in Atlanta eight years ago was a driving factor in returning to graduate school, but that’s actually a partial truth. There were actually _five_ lectures that sparked an interest in design research and grad school. All of them held in vast hotel meeting rooms with hundreds of attendees, but each of them connecting with me on a deeper level.\n\n**Jonah Lehrer, AIGA Gain Conference, October 2008, New York City**\n\nGain was AIGA’s \"Business of Design\" conference[^1] and there was a roster of big wig, influential speakers. Jonah Lehrer was there to talk about his best-selling book, [Proust was a Neuroscientist](https://www.amazon.com/Proust-Was-Neuroscientist-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/0547085907). Lehrer connected creativity with neuroscience advancements, arguing that artists often figured out how the brain worked before scientists did. This concept that neuroscience and creativity could be linked was fascinating to me. A few years after this talk, Lehrer was found to have plagiarized and fabricated quotes in his later works, making this a strange choice to start my list, but after his talk, I started to think about design work a little differently. [There is a recording of the talk, but sadly, no audio for some reason.](https://www.aiga.org/inspiration/talks/jonah-lehrer-2008-gain-conference)\n\n**Malcolm Gladwell, AIGA Gain Conference, October 2008, New York City**\n\nSame conference as Jonah Lehrer, but one day later. Malcolm Gladwell spoke about his forthcoming book, [Outliers](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930). People often criticize Gladwell for oversimplifying the research he builds on, but in that moment — combined with the Lehrer speech the day before — I could see connections between social sciences and design. I read Outliers afterwards and really enjoyed it, but could honestly never really get into Gladwell’s other work. [Hidden somewhere on the AIGA servers is a complete recording of the lecture.](https://www.aiga.org/inspiration/talks/malcolm-gladwell-2008-gain-conference) \n\n**Kevin Larson, Typecon, July 2009, Atlanta**\n\nI loved Typecon Atlanta. Looking back at my notes and blog posts, I wrote about the inspiring speakers, the networking and the creative exploration of letterpress and hand lettering. I did not specifically note a lecture by Kevin Larson, which is really funny, because that’s the one that ended up being most influential for me. Larson is research scientist working for Microsoft and I remember his talk about the science of readability. How does the human brain process letterforms? And then form words and meaning? His general idea was that designers think they understand how readability works, but research shows that other factors are involved and room for improvement. There isn’t a recording around that I’m aware of, but I did find a [2013 talk with Larson and legendary designer Matthew Carter discussing collaborating on the design of a typeface](https://atypi.org/presentation/designing-with-science/) using letter recognition testing. Like the Lehrer and Gladwell talks, the idea of using science to better understand type design was exciting to me.\n\n**Edward Tufte, Presenting Data and Information, February 2017, Atlanta**\n\nIn 2017[^2], I was becoming interested in how information is structured and I’d read a little bit about Edward Tufte’s work. I drove down to Atlanta for a one-day workshop, expecting to learn how to design better presentations. In actuality, I left pondering the difference between designing to persuade and designing to inform. Too often, we don’t try to communicate information and let viewers come to their own conclusions. Instead, when we make presentations, we’ve already drawn conclusions and are trying to persuade people that those conclusions are correct. After the lecture wrapped up, I hopped on I-20 for the normally a 3.5 hour drive. That night, however, it was a 6 hour drive because of an accident on a bridge on the interstate. I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted out of my career.\n\n**Khoi Vinh, AIGA Leadership Retreat, June 2017, Dallas**\n\nThe AIGA Leadership Retreat is a strange event. Part conference, part pep-rally, part-training… chapter board members from all over the United States converge on a conference hotel in a random AIGA city. The 2017 confab was in Dallas and seemed almost entirely focused on IBM’s push into design thinking.[^3] So I was really surprised when Khoi Vinh showed up to talk about the importance of criticism in the design industry. I’d been a fan of Khoi Vinh for a long time since his days at The NY Times and I’d even used his short-lived app, Mixel. For me, this brief talk contrasted with the heavy design thinking push and made me question many of the assumptions I’d made about the design industry on a macro scale. [I found a longer 2018 talk that covers many of the same themes.](https://interaction18.ixda.org/program/talk-thinking-critically-about-design-and-criticism-vinh-khoi/)\n\n---\n\nAt the end of that summer, I started to talk to people around campus trying to figure out which Master’s program I wanted to apply to.

Finding that balance is challenging, but I'm going to keep pushing forward. \n\n### Health\n* <strong>Still stalled.</strong> I had some good progress late in the year, but I've been in neutral for the last couple months. Need to kick it into gear starting tomorrow.\n\n### Projects\n* <strong>Typeface design.</strong> I've got some sketches for an experimental typeface. It's not something that's going to sell so it's been on the back burner, but I feel like I really want to spend some time on it.\n* <strong>InShow.</strong> Do I need another project? Not really. Is InShow 23 coming in 2025? Maybe...\n\n\n### Entertainment\n* <strong>Skeleton Crew.</strong> Still loving this show. Looking forward to an episode tonight and then two more in this season.\n* <strong>What if...?</strong> I know a bunch of people thought this season was weak, but I enjoyed it. Storm as Thor is wonderful. And I always love Captain Carter.\n",

I haven’t decided if I’m going to add it to my daily carry yet, or just use it at home. But I’m thrilled that I have it in my collection and look forward to using it.\n\n[^1]: Dad has found some some great stuff over the years, like [100-year-old litho stones](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2013/1/13/litho-stones?rq=litho) and a [tiny Hamilton Type case.](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2013/6/23/dad-strikes-again?rq=hamilton)\n[^2]: The squeeze converter didn't work well, so I ordered a [twist converter from JetPens](https://www.jetpens.com/Parker-Fountain-Pen-Twist-Converter/pd/6154) that should fit it.\n[^3]: One benefit of the Parker brand is that cartridges are available everywhere. I picked up the ink cartridges at an Office Max near my office.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

You can see previews at [SbB Fonts](http://www.sbbfonts.com).\n* I've got a paper that I need to update and submit to for publication. I'd really like to get it wrapped up this summer before the new semester starts.\n\n### Entertainment\n* Star Trek: Prodigy on Netflix. Working through the episodes slowly. I suck at binge watching.\n* F1, because my daugther got interested and now I'm hooked.\n\n_Posts in the [\"Then\" category](https://bobwertz.com/categories/then/) are archives of my \"Now\" pages._\n",

I didn't even think about logging back into Twitter.\n\nFinally, I’m baffled by friends who remain active on Twitter despite everything that Musk has said and done. They seem addicted to their “audience” and are scared to lose “engagement.” There are other options and it’s time to move on. The sooner you start building a new audience, the sooner you can leave Twitter.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n[^1]: I've added all of these posts to bobwertz.com as part of [my project to move older posts to this site](https://bobwertz.com/2024/05/25/project-repost-moving.html).\n",

				"title": "The Jobification of Volunteer Work",
				"content_html": "<p>Almost 20 years ago, I was in San Francisco for my first AIGA Leadership Retreat. AIGA is a national organization for design<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> and I was a first-time president for the South Carolina chapter. I’d just finished attending a session on leadership and one of my new friends who&rsquo;d been a president before pulled me aside and gave me some advice: “This is supposed to be fun. If it stops being fun, ask for help. You are giving up a bunch of your free time and if you aren’t having fun, it’s not worth it.”</p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking about that advice a lot lately and I’ve come to a realization. Our volunteer “opportunities” have become unpaid part-time jobs. (Maybe they always were…) We are saddled with job descriptions and expectations. We dedicate our time and energy to a cause because we believe in it, but we manage volunteer organizations following the only model we have: business.</p>\n<p>I see it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->churches<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who are looking for people to fill roles and run programs to keep the organization functioning.</p>\n<p>I see it in our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->professional organizations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, like AIGA, where we expect a level of excellence and professionalism on par with what we would expect from our corporate colleagues.</p>\n<p>I see it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->academia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where professors do a massive amount of additional service work in reviewing journal submissions and organizing conferences.</p>\n<p>I see it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recreational youth sports<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where people dedicate nights and weekends to coaching kids year-after-year.</p>\n<p>I see it in our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->organizational boards<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are increasingly trying to recruit people with particular backgrounds and skill sets to provide professional guidance.</p>\n<p>This problem is compounded by how we talk about these volunteer positions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You are giving back, <em>not using your free time.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are offering your skills and abilities, <em>not providing free labor that other people would pay you for.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are providing service to the community, <em>not working for free.</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We talk about this volunteer jobs more like a calling, not a job. And that makes it so much harder to separate from a position that is overwhelming.</p>\n<p>The result of this structure is almost always burnout. Frustration. We often become stuck in our volunteer positions, unable to find someone to take over the incredibly complex structure or programming we have built or maintained. Unsurprisingly, most people — even if they care about deeply about an organization or cause — are unwilling to step up and commit massive time and energy to a cause when they are already juggling their own jobs and family commitments. The volunteer opportunity that you were excited about is now weighing you down and causing stress and anxiety. It’s no longer fun.</p>\n<p>This situation isn’t good for the organizations either. After someone manages to escape from a volunteer position, how often does that person significantly decrease their involvement? I can’t tell you how many people I know who disappear after a long stint on a church council. Or how many former AIGA presidents I know who now have nothing to do with AIGA only a couple of years after their term is over. How many board members step away completely after their service is complete?</p>\n<p>The mission of the organization then shifts from serving the community to finding the volunteers to sustain the organization.</p>\n<p>We need to rethink volunteer leadership.</p>\n<p><strong>The realignment starts at the top.</strong> If the leadership of an organization is overworked and burned out, the other volunteers will assume that’s normal. Some will try to emulate the behavior. Others will leave knowing they can’t commit that much. Our presidents, executive directors and other leadership need to model an appropriate work/life/volunteer balance. Working around the clock isn’t always the long-term, sustainable answer.</p>\n<p><strong>We need to spend less time crafting our job descriptions and more time building relationships.</strong> We’re following the model we know, based on how our business organizations are structured, but I’m not sure that model works in today’s volunteer organization. While we need to make sure expectations are clear, we also need to worry less about the business-like hierarchy and spend more energy on engaging our community. Focus on doing good work, aligned with the mission of the organization.</p>\n<p><strong>We need to be realistic about what we are asking people to do.</strong> Recruit more people to do smaller jobs instead of asking one person to commit a massive amount of time.

				"content_text": "Almost 20 years ago, I was in San Francisco for my first AIGA Leadership Retreat. AIGA is a national organization for design[^1] and I was a first-time president for the South Carolina chapter. I’d just finished attending a session on leadership and one of my new friends who'd been a president before pulled me aside and gave me some advice: “This is supposed to be fun. If it stops being fun, ask for help. You are giving up a bunch of your free time and if you aren’t having fun, it’s not worth it.”\n\nI’ve been thinking about that advice a lot lately and I’ve come to a realization. Our volunteer “opportunities” have become unpaid part-time jobs. (Maybe they always were…) We are saddled with job descriptions and expectations. We dedicate our time and energy to a cause because we believe in it, but we manage volunteer organizations following the only model we have: business. \n\nI see it in <strong>churches</strong>, who are looking for people to fill roles and run programs to keep the organization functioning.\n\nI see it in our <strong>professional organizations</strong>, like AIGA, where we expect a level of excellence and professionalism on par with what we would expect from our corporate colleagues.\n\nI see it in <strong>academia</strong>, where professors do a massive amount of additional service work in reviewing journal submissions and organizing conferences.\n\nI see it in <strong>recreational youth sports</strong>, where people dedicate nights and weekends to coaching kids year-after-year.\n\nI see it in our <strong>organizational boards</strong> that are increasingly trying to recruit people with particular backgrounds and skill sets to provide professional guidance.\n\nThis problem is compounded by how we talk about these volunteer positions:\n\n- You are giving back, _not using your free time._  \n\n- You are offering your skills and abilities, _not providing free labor that other people would pay you for._  \n\n- You are providing service to the community, _not working for free._  \n\nWe talk about this volunteer jobs more like a calling, not a job. And that makes it so much harder to separate from a position that is overwhelming.\n\nThe result of this structure is almost always burnout. Frustration. We often become stuck in our volunteer positions, unable to find someone to take over the incredibly complex structure or programming we have built or maintained. Unsurprisingly, most people — even if they care about deeply about an organization or cause — are unwilling to step up and commit massive time and energy to a cause when they are already juggling their own jobs and family commitments. The volunteer opportunity that you were excited about is now weighing you down and causing stress and anxiety. It’s no longer fun.\n\nThis situation isn’t good for the organizations either. After someone manages to escape from a volunteer position, how often does that person significantly decrease their involvement? I can’t tell you how many people I know who disappear after a long stint on a church council. Or how many former AIGA presidents I know who now have nothing to do with AIGA only a couple of years after their term is over. How many board members step away completely after their service is complete?\n\nThe mission of the organization then shifts from serving the community to finding the volunteers to sustain the organization.\n\nWe need to rethink volunteer leadership.\n\n**The realignment starts at the top.** If the leadership of an organization is overworked and burned out, the other volunteers will assume that’s normal. Some will try to emulate the behavior. Others will leave knowing they can’t commit that much. Our presidents, executive directors and other leadership need to model an appropriate work/life/volunteer balance. Working around the clock isn’t always the long-term, sustainable answer.\n\n**We need to spend less time crafting our job descriptions and more time building relationships.** We’re following the model we know, based on how our business organizations are structured, but I’m not sure that model works in today’s volunteer organization. While we need to make sure expectations are clear, we also need to worry less about the business-like hierarchy and spend more energy on engaging our community. Focus on doing good work, aligned with the mission of the organization. \n\n**We need to be realistic about what we are asking people to do.** Recruit more people to do smaller jobs instead of asking one person to commit a massive amount of time. Maybe in the past, you recruited one or two people to run an event. Maybe you should instead recruit 5-10 to cover the same amount of work. And if we can’t find the needed volunteers, it is time to scale back the project or event to be more reasonable.\n\n**We need to be thankful for the contributions of others, no matter how small.** Too often, we thank volunteers by presenting them with opportunities to embrace an ever-increasing volunteer workload. We need to actively discourage overcommitment… and never ask for more than anyone should rationally be able to give.\n\n**We need to be thoughtful to fellow volunteers.** It’s easy to get frustrated when people drop the ball. We need to check in on each other, be supportive and remember that we are all doing this for free, in our spare time, because we support the same cause and the same mission. We need to be understanding, not judgmental. We need to offer support, not criticism.\n\n**Understand the difference between governance and micromanagement.** Yes, we need boards to make sure that the money is being handled properly and the mission is well-defined. But the board shouldn’t micromanage everything. We need to let people do the tasks we ask them to do.\n\n**Be flexible.** Life can change in the blink of an eye. Be flexible with expectations. Be understanding when things don’t turn out the way you wanted. And realize that every volunteer is balancing life and work and family.\n\n**And finally, we need to remember to have fun.** These organizations and boards that we support, love and commit our time to… they should be enjoyable. And if they aren’t, it’s time to fix them.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

He was upset with his doctor that they'd done both knees at the same time, and told him that “next time, we’re doing them one at a time.” The doctor told him “Mr. Jones. You are 99 years old. We aren’t doing another knee replacement.”\n\nI tell that story often, but realized I’ve never written it down. I love how many lessons about attitudes, expectations and perspective are packed into one story. GiGi passed away a few years ago, living to the age of 98. Today would have been her 101st birthday. There are many stories to tell, but this is the story I tell about her most often and wanted to share it on her birthday.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n[^1]: Growing up, I called her “Grandmother Caldwell.” My cousin called her “Granny.” But once the grandkids arrived, she became “GiGi.”\n",

The Adobe Firefly site lists one feature as coming soon, Recolor Vectors. I’m not sure how that will differ from the Recolor Artwork feature in Adobe Illustrator, but I’m looking forward to trying it out. Several other features are teased as “In exploration” and some of them look interesting. No idea how close to release these are — for all I know, they are ideas on a white board — but “text to vector” and “extend background” could be fun to play with. I’ll likely write additional posts as new features are introduced.\n\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n",

In the screenshot below, I used the \"Post Length\" setting.\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2023/bcb409869f.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the category filter.\" title=\"postfilter.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"255\" />    \n\n3. **Determine the URL for each category.** Each category in Micro.Blog has a URL, typically formatted as `http://DOMAIN-NAME/categories/CATEGORY-NAME.` Find the URLs for each of the categories you want in the navigation.\n\n4. **Create a new page.** Name the page and then paste the category URL into the content box.  Make sure “Include this page in your blog navigation” is checked. Repeat for all of your categories. You’ll then have a navigation item for each of your categories. \n\nThis technique works really well when paired with the Custom Home Page plug in. You can see the result in the navigation [on my site.](http://www.bobwertz.com) I know that I could do this by building a custom template. At some point, maybe I will. But right now, I'd like to keep it as simple as I can, and this works really well for me.\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n",

So I figured I'd go with superscript numbers, which is more conventional anyway.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; I continue to use divider lines to separate the body of the post from the footnotes, and a second divider line between the footnotes and a bio.\n\nI'm not sure what I want to do with the bio. I found that most of my traffic came from Google, so the reader was dropping in on my site with no idea who I was. For now, I've decided to go with the shortest one sentence bio that I could and set it at the end in italics.\n\nOne aspect that I haven't yet decided on is images. On my Squarespace-hosted site, each post had a preview image and I'd include a post image. So far on bobwertz.com, I don't need a preview image, but I do think I want to create some type of standard post image to include under the subhead. I'll keep experimenting, but I feel good about my basic post format.\n\n--- \n\n1. I'm going to keep writing at Sketchbook B, but the content will be mostly Adobe Creative Cloud tips.\n2. I'm using a trial of MarsEdit right now. And I really love the preview engine that lets me see how this is going to look, even before I post it. Looks like I'll be purchasing a license.\n3. I don't love how the superscripts mess with the overall line spacing. It just feels wrong. I may try to come up with another approach.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n",

				"title": "Twitterless, Part III",
				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"preparing-for-a-future-without-twitter\">Preparing for a future without Twitter.</h2>\n<p>I’ve been preparing for the demise of Twitter since long before Elon Musk made the offer to purchase it. In 2016, I wrote a post — <a href=\"https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2016/11/9/twitterless\">Twitterless</a> — about what would happen if Twitter “disappeared tomorrow.” I outlined a couple of key areas that would be problematic for me and possible solutions.</p>\n<p>A year and a half later, I wrote a follow up post — <a href=\"https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/3/twitterless-part-ii?rq=twitterless\">Twitterless, Part II</a> — that noted my progress on replacing the role Twitter plays for me, and the challenges that still existed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Times are changing, though, and I honestly believe that we all need to be diversifying — and if possible, owning — our social media presence. Becoming less reliant on the big social media behemoths is the first step.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I ended that post with a promise to follow up on my progress, but as Facebook became more and more evil, I focused <a href=\"https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/6/22/another-why-i-am-quitting-facebook-post?rq=facebook\">on moving away from Facebook.</a> Replacing Twitter was pushed to the back burner.</p>\n<p>Now that Twitter armageddon may or may not be here, it’s clearly time that I renew my quest to find an alternative. I figured I’d check back in on those questions that I asked back in 2016 and see how I’ve done:</p>\n<p><strong>I’d lose a bunch of contacts.</strong> Yep. I’m going to lose a bunch of people who follow me on Twitter. I’ve tried to connect with people on other platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram, but I can’t find everyone, and you know what, I’m okay with that.</p>\n<p><strong>I’d change how I watch live events.</strong> This is still a problem as <a href=\"https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/06/live-events-and.html\">I noted yesterday.</a> Live events are fun to follow with other people, and Twitter is great for that. No other service is quite like Twitter for those instant commentary events.</p>\n<p><strong>I’d have to rethink how I find articles and stories.</strong> I use <a href=\"http://www.feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a> as an RSS reader, but that’s not my only solution. I subscribe directly to <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post.</em> And — as shocking as it might seem — I also get a lot of value out of Apple News+, which I get with our Apple One bundle.

				"content_text": "## Preparing for a future without Twitter.\n\nI’ve been preparing for the demise of Twitter since long before Elon Musk made the offer to purchase it. In 2016, I wrote a post — [Twitterless](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2016/11/9/twitterless) — about what would happen if Twitter “disappeared tomorrow.” I outlined a couple of key areas that would be problematic for me and possible solutions.\n\nA year and a half later, I wrote a follow up post — [Twitterless, Part II](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/3/twitterless-part-ii?rq=twitterless) — that noted my progress on replacing the role Twitter plays for me, and the challenges that still existed.\n\n> Times are changing, though, and I honestly believe that we all need to be diversifying — and if possible, owning — our social media presence. Becoming less reliant on the big social media behemoths is the first step.\n\nI ended that post with a promise to follow up on my progress, but as Facebook became more and more evil, I focused [on moving away from Facebook.](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/6/22/another-why-i-am-quitting-facebook-post?rq=facebook) Replacing Twitter was pushed to the back burner.\n\nNow that Twitter armageddon may or may not be here, it’s clearly time that I renew my quest to find an alternative. I figured I’d check back in on those questions that I asked back in 2016 and see how I’ve done:\n\n**I’d lose a bunch of contacts.** Yep. I’m going to lose a bunch of people who follow me on Twitter. I’ve tried to connect with people on other platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram, but I can’t find everyone, and you know what, I’m okay with that. \n\n**I’d change how I watch live events.** This is still a problem as [I noted yesterday.](https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/06/live-events-and.html) Live events are fun to follow with other people, and Twitter is great for that. No other service is quite like Twitter for those instant commentary events.\n\n**I’d have to rethink how I find articles and stories.** I use [Feedbin](http://www.feedbin.com) as an RSS reader, but that’s not my only solution. I subscribe directly to _The New York Times_ and _The Washington Post._ And — as shocking as it might seem — I also get a lot of value out of Apple News+, which I get with our Apple One bundle. My local paper, _The State_, is included in with Apple News+ and I catch a random assortment of articles from sources I don’t normally read. It’s a nice way to diversify the news I see every day.\n\n**I’d have to rethink how I share content.** When I wrote this, I felt like traffic to my blog was coming primarily from Twitter, but over time, that lessened and most come through search engines. I’ll still create and share, but I’ll just use whatever channels are available at the time.\n\n**I’d change the way I use Facebook/Instagram.** I once thought that Facebook and Instagram might provide a solution. I’ve mostly left Facebook, and Meta seems to only care about the Metaverse now anyway. I’m not that interested in Instagram now that it’s trying to be TikTok. I don’t feel any better about Facebook than I do about Twitter.\n\n**I’d try to find a replacement.** I backed the [Micro.Blog Kickstarter]([https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing]) back in 2017 and I’ve had a paid account ever since. I originally [connected Micro.Blog to my Squarespace site](https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/17/microblog-and-squarespace), which worked well over the years. I believe in the idea of a feed-based, open social media platform, but because I was still using Twitter, I didn’t fully commit to using Micro.Blog. \n\nI’ve still got [Sketchbook B](http://www.sketchbookb.com) and it’s still hosted on Squarespace, but I made the decision this summer that all of my future blog and short-form posting will be hosted on Micro.Blog, specifically, [bobwertz.com](http://www.bobwertz.com).

It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>\n<p>Apple has one of the most recognizable logos in the world. Which isn’t surprising because they are the largest company in the world. I’ve been watching a couple of trends over the last few months about how Apple uses their logos and this week, those trends have become even more apparent. For brand managers and designers, I think there is something interesting going on and it’s worth digging into the mystery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-logo-is-missing\">The logo is “missing.”</h3>\n<p>Apple isn’t afraid to use their logos. All of their computers have prominent logos. They include logo stickers in all of their boxes. Apple’s logo is everywhere. But on their new iMac, which was released this week, Apple’s logo is on the back, but not on the front. The last few generations of iMac’s have featured a prominent logo on the back and a second logo on the “chin,” facing the user. The new iMac has no user facing logo.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But the iMac isn’t the only recent Apple product with an interesting logo story. I first noticed Apple’s changing logo use with the introduction of the AirPod Max, which has no Apple logos at all on the product. There is plenty of room for a logo on the side of the headphones, but there is none to be found.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I guessed the AirPods Max was the only Apple product without a logo, but I was wrong. For some reason I assumed that my AirPods case had the Apple logo on it, but guess what? It doesn’t. I checked Apple’s website and the AirPods Pro don’t have a logo either. (Although according to Apple’s website and an iFixit teardown, the chip inside the AirPods Pro has a tiny logo printed on it.) My Apple Watch has a tiny Apple logo on the bottom on it, but it’s not visible when it’s being worn. Apple doesn’t include logos on any of their wearable products.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But that’s not all. I’ve been trying out Apple Fitness+ and there are tons of visible logos. Nike logos. All of the instructors seem to be wearing Nike gear. There are no Apple logos. No special Apple Fitness+ shirts. No little Apple “watermark” in the corner of the screen. An Apple logo isn’t hidden somewhere on the set.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I checked Apple’s competitors. Amazon, Samsung and Microsoft all include their logo on the charging case for their AirPod competitors. Sony and Google even managed to get their logo on the earbud itself. None of the competing smartwatches that I looked at had logos, although Samsung etched “Galaxy Watch” into the crown for some reason.</p>\n<p>In the fitness space, Peloton employees sport logo apparel while they lead classes. And the instructors on Nike’s fitness apps obviously sport Nike gear.</p>\n<p>So what’s going on? I’m not sure.</p>\n<p>My first reaction is it’s just an issue of taste. Placing logos all over a product is tacky — especially for wearables. And Apple is showing their superior taste by acknowledging that consumers don’t always want to be sporting company logos. Maybe? But lots of premium and luxury brands include logos on their products. And Apple isn’t exactly shy about using their logo.</p>\n<p>It’s not about the logo size. Even the Apple Pencil has a logo. And as I mentioned, the chips inside the AirPods have logos printed on them. (The chips… inside the case… that the consumer never sees…)</p>\n<p>The absence of a logo is even stranger when you realize the original intent of a trademarked logo: to clearly identify the manufacturer. With a company like Apple, whose designs are ripped off more than about any other tech company, their logo is the part of the design that absolutely can’t be legally copied.</p>\n<p>My best guess is that Apple thinks that their product designs are unique enough, that they don’t even need a logo. People will know AirPods are an Apple product when they see them. The Apple Fitness+ workouts feel like Apple even if their logo isn’t present. I don’t think any other company can make a desktop computer that looks like the new iMac. Apple’s presence is understood because of the overall production quality and design. A logo isn’t necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-logo-is-incognito\">The logo is “incognito.”</h3>\n<p>Typical corporate logo standards are incredibly strict. Apple doesn’t publish their internal brand guidelines, but it’s clear they do allow some more playful uses of their mark. For example, they often use illustrated versions of their logo to promote their media events, like they did for this week’s Spring Forward event. Allowing logo variations in large corporate identity systems isn’t uncommon, but those variations are typically used for structural identifications between organizational divisions or product lines.</p>\n<p>But Apple is using logo variants that align with their values.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In 2014, Apple started using a logo with a green leaf in their retail stores on Earth Day.

Yes, the logo is part of that, but Apple’s visual branding extends far beyond just their logo.

Their visual differentiation extends far beyond just their logo and their identity is stronger for it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Think about how a visual identity can reflect a company’s values.</strong> Most of the time, visual identity reflects an organization’s structure, but connecting your visual brand to your corporate values is potentially more powerful. Apple uses logo variations that support their beliefs, not their hierarchy.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’ll never hear from their branding team and Apple doesn’t publicly share their logo and branding guidelines.

Repetition and consistency are the foundation of contemporary brand management, but Apple has decided to not use their logo in some places and change it in others.

It’s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>\n<p>I grew up loving magazines. Any time I’d be interested in something, I’d head to the magazine aisle in the bookstore or grocery store and look for magazines on the topic. Computers, cars, boats, science, model railroads, photography, sports, baseball cards, comics, design and more. It didn’t matter what I was interested in, there was at least one magazine on the topic.</p>\n<p>Growing up in the pre-internet days, these magazines provided the info I was looking for. Detailed, up-to-date, authoritative info about whatever geeky habits I was interested in. Even the ads were informative and useful. I subscribed to some of them. Others, I’d buy if the main topics that month interested me.</p>\n<p>The internet destroyed these publications. The first blow came from blogs. Authoritative people writing about the things they loved that people could read for free. The second blow was Google, which could route you to exactly what you were looking for. For various reasons — mostly related to monetization — the blog revolution failed to really take hold. Google’s search engine algorithm seemed to reward people with better SEO tactics over more authoritative sources. When I search Google for resources today, it’s hard to tell if what I’ve found is up-to-date or reputable. More often than not, I’m led to dated post of questionable origin that barely answers my question.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>I was excited about the introduction of Apple News+. Access to hundreds of magazines for $10 a month. The service is nothing world-changing. I’ve absolutely gotten my money’s worth and will continue to subscribe. Surprisingly, though, I discovered I’d already filled the need for a detailed, up-to-date, authoritative source for my geeky habits: podcasting.</p>\n<p>I use podcasts the same way I used special interest magazines as a kid.</p>\n<p>If I’m interested in a topic, I find a podcast. Computers, design, photography, business, pens, science fiction, pop culture, sports, meditation and more. I subscribe to many of these podcasts in Overcast<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, while others I only listen to a few episodes. Even the ads are informative and relevant. Podcasts are how I learn about and explore new topics.</p>\n<p>Some people think of podcasting as an evolution of talk radio. Others feel it’s more an audio form of blogging.

It’s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site._\n\nI grew up loving magazines. Any time I’d be interested in something, I’d head to the magazine aisle in the bookstore or grocery store and look for magazines on the topic. Computers, cars, boats, science, model railroads, photography, sports, baseball cards, comics, design and more. It didn’t matter what I was interested in, there was at least one magazine on the topic.\n\nGrowing up in the pre-internet days, these magazines provided the info I was looking for. Detailed, up-to-date, authoritative info about whatever geeky habits I was interested in. Even the ads were informative and useful. I subscribed to some of them. Others, I’d buy if the main topics that month interested me.\n\nThe internet destroyed these publications. The first blow came from blogs. Authoritative people writing about the things they loved that people could read for free. The second blow was Google, which could route you to exactly what you were looking for. For various reasons — mostly related to monetization — the blog revolution failed to really take hold. Google’s search engine algorithm seemed to reward people with better SEO tactics over more authoritative sources. When I search Google for resources today, it’s hard to tell if what I’ve found is up-to-date or reputable. More often than not, I’m led to dated post of questionable origin that barely answers my question.[^1]\n\nI was excited about the introduction of Apple News+. Access to hundreds of magazines for $10 a month. The service is nothing world-changing. I’ve absolutely gotten my money’s worth and will continue to subscribe. Surprisingly, though, I discovered I’d already filled the need for a detailed, up-to-date, authoritative source for my geeky habits: podcasting.\n\nI use podcasts the same way I used special interest magazines as a kid. \n\nIf I’m interested in a topic, I find a podcast. Computers, design, photography, business, pens, science fiction, pop culture, sports, meditation and more. I subscribe to many of these podcasts in Overcast[^2], while others I only listen to a few episodes. Even the ads are informative and relevant. Podcasts are how I learn about and explore new topics.\n\nSome people think of podcasting as an evolution of talk radio. Others feel it’s more an audio form of blogging. I suppose I don’t have an issue with either of those opinions, but for me, podcasts serve a vital role as a replacement for the special interest magazine.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

I identified what I would miss without Twitter and decided to start looking for options to address some potential pain points.\n\nIn the last year, the narrative has shifted from Twitter’s possible sale to issues with abuse and hatred.

I’d try them all, but I’m not sure there can truly be a replacement for Twitter.\n\n### But… reality.\n\nSo I don’t think Twitter will just shut down. At some point, the price to purchase the company gets so low, that someone will take a chance on them. I’m more concerned that Twitter, or a company that buys Twitter, will change it so completely, that it becomes useless.\n\nThis exercise had forced me, though, to start evaluating areas where I am too reliant on Twitter. I'm going to start connecting to designers and thought leaders on other channels. I'm looking for new avenues to find and share content. I'll evaluate how I use channels like Facebook, Instagram, Dribbble, YouTube and Medium.\n\nTwitter might not disappear, but it's still best not to keep your eggs in one basket.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.
