In contrast to the commentary-driven media, I suppose this is expert-driven media.\n\nThe reality is that most people prefer the commentary-driven approach. They feel part of the conversation. They can contribute if they want. They want to hear the opinions of others and argue about topics. Our current social media landscape was designed for them. They want to feel that their opinion is a vital part of the conversation. That is the format.\n\nCultivating an expert-driven media environment is tougher and it appeals to a smaller audience. But there *is* a significant audience. There are plenty of people who want to read posts and articles from people who know what they are talking about. An ample audience of people who want to listen to podcasts and watch informative videos. We just have to design a system that prioritizes meaningful content and encourages sharing well-thought out responses over quick, thoughtless knee-jerk commentary.\n\nWith the implosion of Twitter, I feel like we have an opportunity to build something different. I‚Äôm happy with Micro.Blog right now and look forward to its continued development. I‚Äôm interested in the resurgence of RSS <sup>2</sup>&nbsp; and the momentum behind new indie-web protocols like ActivityPub. I‚Äôm encouraged that so many people are experimenting with different approaches to ‚Äúsocial‚Äù media. I can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next.\n\n---\n\n1. Every third caller wants their team to throw more to the tight end.\n\n2. Some of us never let RSS go.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n",
