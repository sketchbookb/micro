This study combines a content analysis of 335 posts on the logo review website <em>Brand New</em> with the voting data from their polls to understand how visual context correlates with a viewer’s initial response.

When I started grad school, I didn’t really know anything about scholarly research. In the spring of 2019 — my second semester as a grad student — I took a content analysis class with Carol Pardun. I was the only master’s level student in a class full of Ph.D. students. I felt so overwhelmed by the pressure to come up with an idea and learn methods and theories on the fly. The paper I wrote for that class was the first version of this paper. It was accepted to the AEJMC Conference that August and I presented in Toronto — my first academic conference presentation. I loved the concept for the study and got great feedback, but I was still learning and felt like I could improve it. I scrapped everything, started over with a larger sample and better methodology. After Dr. Pardun retired, I started working with Tara Mortensen on the next evolution of this work, which turned into my thesis. And that thesis eventually became this paper.</p>\n<p>Thanks go out to so many people who’ve help me along the way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dr. Pardun for supporting my bizarre little project, especially in the early days when the project was taking shape.</li>\n<li>All of the Ph.D. students in that content analysis class who helped me figure things out and took me under their wing.</li>\n<li>Dr. Mortensen for taking over as my thesis director and helping guide me through the publication process.</li>\n<li>Kevin Hull and Van Kornegay for serving on my committee and providing helpful feedback.</li>\n<li>Robert McKeever and Jacob Long for giving me an appropriate foundation for analyzing data.</li>\n<li>Editor Cleopatra Veloutsou who guided me through the process with the <em>Journal of Product and Brand Management</em>.</li>\n<li>All of the reviewers and discussants at the conference level for AEJMC and in the peer review process whose feedback legitimately made this paper better.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And of course, this couldn’t have happened without the rest of Team Wertz. Liz and the kids have been so supportive and patient while I have embarked on this grad school journey. (And occasionally, Norah and Jill even joined me at Starbucks when I had to write.) I simply could not have done it without them.</p>\n<p>I’ve still got a few years left until I finish my classwork and dissertation, but I’m exceptionally proud of this milestone and excited to see where my research goes next.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.</em></p>\n",

The paper I wrote for that class was the first version of this paper. It was accepted to the AEJMC Conference that August and I presented in Toronto — my first academic conference presentation. I loved the concept for the study and got great feedback, but I was still learning and felt like I could improve it. I scrapped everything, started over with a larger sample and better methodology. After Dr. Pardun retired, I started working with Tara Mortensen on the next evolution of this work, which turned into my thesis. And that thesis eventually became this paper.\n\nThanks go out to so many people who’ve help me along the way:\n* Dr. Pardun for supporting my bizarre little project, especially in the early days when the project was taking shape.\n* All of the Ph.D. students in that content analysis class who helped me figure things out and took me under their wing.\n* Dr. Mortensen for taking over as my thesis director and helping guide me through the publication process. \n* Kevin Hull and Van Kornegay for serving on my committee and providing helpful feedback.\n* Robert McKeever and Jacob Long for giving me an appropriate foundation for analyzing data. \n* Editor Cleopatra Veloutsou who guided me through the process with the _Journal of Product and Brand Management_.\n* All of the reviewers and discussants at the conference level for AEJMC and in the peer review process whose feedback legitimately made this paper better.\n\nAnd of course, this couldn’t have happened without the rest of Team Wertz. Liz and the kids have been so supportive and patient while I have embarked on this grad school journey. (And occasionally, Norah and Jill even joined me at Starbucks when I had to write.) I simply could not have done it without them.\n\nI’ve still got a few years left until I finish my classwork and dissertation, but I’m exceptionally proud of this milestone and excited to see where my research goes next.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n\n",

There's a reveal at the end of the episode... a revelation to keep the newly updated viewer hooked to come back next week.\n\nAs I watched it, I realized that this type of clip show episode — once a staple of 20+ episode network TV seasons — will likely fade from existence. Streaming services like Disney+ allow people to go back and watch the whole season easily. And shorter seasons mean that you don't need a budget-friendly recap episode. In today's streaming world, there is simply no longer a reason to make a clip show.[^2] \n\nWe are in the midst of a huge shift in television. Most of the attention is directed at the financial aspects of the streaming era. The demise of the clip show episode is a comparatively minor shift, but it demonstrates how the changing financial model of the television industry directly shapes the creative product itself.\n\n---\n\n<em>Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.</em>\n\n[^1]: Alias:Rambaldi :: Lost:The Island.\n[^2]: Just to be clear, most clip shows aren't great television.\n",

We are in a fascinating period of change in the services we use online and the ways we share information. Specifically, I'm interested in three questions:\n\n1. <strong>Will Instagram users actually adopt it?</strong> This is the big question. Will the people I follow on Instagram start accounts? And will they post content that I'm interested in? What will the demographics of the user base be? So many question about what this audience might look like.\n\n2. <strong>How will the ActivityPub implementation work?</strong> As a devoted Micro.Blog user, I'm interested in the rumored ActivityPub integration. Will I be able to follow Threads users on Micro.Blog? Can I cross post from Micro.Blog? As the first mainstream ActivityPub implementation, it will be interesting to see how they connect with the larger Fediverse.\n\n3. <strong>What's the media narrative?</strong> It's guaranteed that there will be a direct contrast with the dumpster fire that Twitter has become, but what other media narratives will take shape. How will it be compared to Mastodon and Bluesky? Will media coverage increase consumer knowledge about the ActivityPub?

I’ve spent a little bit of time experimenting with Adobe Firefly and wanted to share some initial impressions.\n\n### Text to image\n\nThe text to image feature is straightforward. Type in a prompt and Firefly generates four images. On the right, there is a palette with options that lets you refine your request. You can choose the aspect ratio, content type, style, lighting and composition. Below is a screenshot of the interface and a few examples of what it can do:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/22497739cd.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 03 26 at 9 47 54 AM\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-03-26 at 9.47.54 AM.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"418\" />\n\n<strong>Prompt:</strong> green metal fish-shaped spaceship on an alien planet   \n<strong>Styles:</strong> art, concept art, dramatic light, flat colors\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/d29fb590fe.png\" alt=\"Firefly green+metal fish shaped spaceship on an alien planet art concept art dramatic light flat colors 77148\" title=\"Firefly_green+metal fish-shaped spaceship on an alien planet_art,concept_art,dramatic_light,flat_colors_77148.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"342\" />\n\n<strong>Prompt: </strong>green hot rod racing through the desert   \n<strong>Styles:</strong> photo, muted, blurry background, backlighting, science fiction\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/012c8e0fa1.png\" alt=\"Firefly green+hot rod racing through the desert photo muted blurry background backlighting science fiction 50326\" title=\"Firefly_green+hot rod racing through the desert_photo,muted,blurry_background,backlighting,science_fiction_50326.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"342\" />\n\n<strong>Prompt:</strong> loose sketch of a white male with a green sweater and a stubble beard typing on a laptop in a coffee shop   \n<strong>Styles:</strong> art\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/ca74dc6010.png\" alt=\"Firefly loose+sketch of a white male with a green sweater and a stubble beard typing on a laptop in a coffee shop art 39460\" title=\"Firefly_loose+sketch of a white male with a green sweater and a stubble beard typing on a laptop in a coffee shop_art_39460.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"342\" />\n\nA couple of quick reflections on using Firefly’s Text to Image feature:\n<ul>\n\t<li> For the content type, I feel art worked best for the creations I generated.</li>\n\t<li> The select similar button lets you refine easily</li>\n\t<li> Realistic people and animals are a struggle. I accidentally generated a person with two noses. And sometimes, an arm connects in the wrong spot.</li>\n\t<li> If you include too many prompts, Firefly often doesn’t know how to resolve them all and you get strange results.</li>\n</ul>\n\n### Text Effects\n\nText Effects lets you specify and apply an AI-generated effect to some text. Firefly has a few sample effects that give you a good idea of what the feature can do. You can choose from 12 different fonts. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/d26d3d2a4a.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 03 26 at 10 14 23 AM\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-03-26 at 10.14.23 AM.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"418\" />\n\n<strong>Prompt:</strong> Green fluffy clouds, tight fit, transparent background\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/c4fb399ec0.png\" width=\"599\" height=\"462\" alt=\"Green fluffy clouds, tight fit, transparent background\" />\n\n<strong>Prompt: </strong>Circuit boards, tight fit, grey background\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/f12f4e1a5a.png\" alt=\"Firefly circuit+boards 32694\" title=\"Firefly_circuit+boards_32694.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"257\" />\n\n<strong>Prompt: </strong>Flowers and Rocks, loose fit, white background\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/847de8f1e5.png\" alt=\"Firefly flowers+and rocks 34224\" title=\"Firefly_flowers+and rocks_34224.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"430\" />\n\nA couple of notes:\n<ul>\n\t<li>If you have two of the same letter, they are identical. And while I understand that, it ruins the hand-created art look. Hopefully they’ll change this in future versions.</li>\n\t<li>The transparent background works well when you use the loose fit because elements overflow the shape of the letters.</li>\n\t<li>I could see this feature being built into Adobe apps eventually.</li>\n</ul>\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAdobe Firefly is definitely a work in progress – it is a beta – but there are more features in development. The Adobe Firefly site lists one feature as coming soon, Recolor Vectors. I’m not sure how that will differ from the Recolor Artwork feature in Adobe Illustrator, but I’m looking forward to trying it out.

The hope was that by breaking some bad habits I developed during COVID, I could lose some weight and feel better. I wanted to post occasional updates to keep myself accountable.</p>\n<p>Two months in, things are going great. I feel significantly better — that’s the “metric” I care about most — and I’ve dropped a significant amount of weight. I’m not doing any trendy diet or counting calories. I’ve adapted some principles from intuitive eating.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> I’m making smarter decisions about food and listening to my body. One example, I’ve pretty much stopped drinking beverages with calories. At Starbucks, I get a black coffee or hot tea. Unsweetened tea instead of sweet tea.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> I’m not drinking sodas. I’ve generally avoided alcoholic drinks, but had a glass of bourbon at our Valentine’s Dinner. My energy level feels more consistent through the day without the sugary sodas and extra caffeine. And I’m sleeping better. Wins all around.</p>\n<p>Exercise wise, I’m just focused on movement.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> I’m walking regularly. My wife and I have started taking long walks on the weekends, exploring the trails that are literally <a href=\"https://www.icrc.net/parks/mungo-park\"><em>in our backyard.</em></a> I’m trying to walk at lunch and walk to meetings around campus. I’m not running on a treadmill — or running at all. I might get to that point, but that’s down the road.</p>\n<p>I do want to address the tech side of this. I purchased a <a href=\"https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus\">Withings Body+</a> scale, and it syncs my weight to my Apple Health account. I use <a href=\"https://happyscale.com\">Happy Scale</a> to track weight because it does a nice job of showing averages instead of just focusing on the lowest weigh in. I’m tracking activity and workouts with Apple Watch. I tend to be a data person, and I like having all these metrics. I just need to make sure I’m not fixated on the metrics. Again, the main goal is feeling better and developing healthy habits.</p>\n<p>Two months in, I feel like I’m heading in the right direction. I’m making long-term lifestyle changes, and I know this is just a start. I plan to check back in here every month or so with an update.</p>\n<p><em>Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina.

I feel significantly better — that’s the “metric” I care about most — and I’ve dropped a significant amount of weight. I’m not doing any trendy diet or counting calories. I’ve adapted some principles from intuitive eating.[^1] I’m making smarter decisions about food and listening to my body. One example, I’ve pretty much stopped drinking beverages with calories. At Starbucks, I get a black coffee or hot tea. Unsweetened tea instead of sweet tea.[^2] I’m not drinking sodas. I’ve generally avoided alcoholic drinks, but had a glass of bourbon at our Valentine’s Dinner. My energy level feels more consistent through the day without the sugary sodas and extra caffeine. And I’m sleeping better. Wins all around.\n\nExercise wise, I’m just focused on movement.[^3] I’m walking regularly. My wife and I have started taking long walks on the weekends, exploring the trails that are literally [_in our backyard._](https://www.icrc.net/parks/mungo-park) I’m trying to walk at lunch and walk to meetings around campus. I’m not running on a treadmill — or running at all. I might get to that point, but that’s down the road.\n\nI do want to address the tech side of this. I purchased a [Withings Body+](https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus) scale, and it syncs my weight to my Apple Health account. I use [Happy Scale](https://happyscale.com) to track weight because it does a nice job of showing averages instead of just focusing on the lowest weigh in. I’m tracking activity and workouts with Apple Watch. I tend to be a data person, and I like having all these metrics. I just need to make sure I’m not fixated on the metrics. Again, the main goal is feeling better and developing healthy habits.\n\nTwo months in, I feel like I’m heading in the right direction. I’m making long-term lifestyle changes, and I know this is just a start. I plan to check back in here every month or so with an update.\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina. And he's trying to be healthier._\n\n[^1]: Clearly, I’ve not bought in to intuitive eating 100%. I’m still trying to lose weight and I still weigh myself regularly. If you want to learn more about intuitive eating, I recommend [Rachael Hartley's blog.](https://www.rachaelhartleynutrition.com/blog)\n[^2]: I’m in South Carolina, y’all. Around here, sweet tea is the default.\n[^3]: This is another intuitive eating thing. More [here.](https://www.rachaelhartleynutrition.com/blog/how-to-learn-intuitive-movement)\n\n\n",

My oldest started her senior year of high school and is trying to figure out where she wants to go to college, but then tore her ACL in a lacrosse tournament and also had to have surgery. My two youngest each started a new school, which changed our morning routine significantly. Everyone is doing great, but there is always a lot going on.\n\nAnd grad school has been _fine_. I’ve done well. I’ve written lots of papers that I am proud of and had research accepted to a conference. I’m trying to get my papers edited and submitted to journals. Classes have been good, but honestly, I haven’t enjoyed grad school for the last year. And that has been weighing on me.\n\nThe balance is off.\n\nI’ve been in grad school part-time for 4.5 years straight at this point — 3 for the Master’s and 1.5 for the Ph.D. With all the changes in my job and life, I wasn’t getting the most out of my Ph.D. studies.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; So I’ve decided to take the spring semester off. It’s a tough decision — I’ve been steadily working on my degrees one or two classes at a time — but it’s the right decision. I need to pause and reset the balance between work, home and school. I’m not quitting, just taking a break. I know I’ll start back up in the summer or fall, fully recharged and ready to continue to the finish.\n\n---\n\n1. One of my professors told me that by working on my Ph.D. part time, I had the “gift of time.” Most people have to sprint through their program so they can get a teaching job. By not rushing through my program, I could get the most out of it and enjoy it.\n\n---\n\n_Bob Wertz is a creative director, type designer, Ph.D. student and researcher living in Columbia, South Carolina._\n",
