			 <p>Thanks to the librarians at the University of South Carolina, I have a scan of my 1997 honors thesis. It&rsquo;s not terrible&hellip; and it is full of fun 1997 acronyms, like UPN, CNNSI, ESPNET and CNET.</p>

			 <p>I want to find a copy of my 1997 honors thesis.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I wrote it on a Power Mac 7500 in Word Perfect 3.5 on the classic Mac OS 8. It probably fit on a floppy drive, but I know I saved a backup copy of it on a Zip drive. At some point, I decided that I needed to move things off the Zip disks and consolidated all of my old files from college onto DVDs. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure where that DVD is now, but I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s in my attic. Even if the disc hasn&rsquo;t been ruined by the South Carolina heat, I don&rsquo;t actually have a DVD drive to read it.</p>
<p>And then I remembered that the University of South Carolina library has the official copy in the off-site annex. I can request that they pull the physical copy for me to review in person at South Carolinina Library. It&rsquo;s a bound copy of the actual sheets of paper I printed and turned in at Harper College almost 30 years ago. I&rsquo;m going to request it next week and we&rsquo;ll see how long it takes to get it out of storage.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I suppose the moral of the story is don&rsquo;t trust your archives to digital formats. A lot can go wrong.</p>

			 <p>Listening to a podcast this week and I realized that my 1997 honors thesis about media branding in the age of cable TV and the internet is actually relevant as media branding continues to change. I might dust it off and turn it into a history of media branding instead.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving week was busy. I worked Monday and Tuesday, took Wednesday off and the university was closed for Thursday and Friday. It was a much needed rest. We had Norah home from college so it was nice to have all of Team Wertz under the same roof for the first time for a while.</p>
<p>Hard to believe it&rsquo;s December. I need to switch into gear to finish up the year strong. We&rsquo;ve got my wife&rsquo;s birthday this week and it&rsquo;s her last week of graduate classes.</p>

			 <p>The last two weeks has seen a surge in Bluesky usage. I&rsquo;ve been on Bluesky a little since the early days. I liked the service, but I didn&rsquo;t know any one there. That&rsquo;s changed now and lots of friends are posting. That&rsquo;s added a touch more complexity, so I figured I&rsquo;d share how I&rsquo;m handling my personal social media right now.</p>
<ol>
<li>I post everything to Micro.Blog. It shows up on bobwertz.com.</li>
<li>Micro.Blog crossposts everything to Bluesky, Threads and Mastodon.</li>
<li>I have notifications turned off on my iPhone, so I have no idea when people respond to what I post.</li>
<li>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->selectively<!-- raw HTML omitted --> choose when I want to engage with social media on whatever site feels right at the time.</li>
</ol>
<p>A couple of random things I&rsquo;ve noticed lately:</p>
<ol>
<li>My Instagram usage has dropped dramatically, probably because it isn&rsquo;t tied in with my crossposting system. They don&rsquo;t have a posting API, so no one can really add that connection. I like Instagram, but I don&rsquo;t have time for everything.</li>
<li>Cotton Bureau included one of my shirt designs in their 25% off sale. Normally, I would have helped promote on Instagram and Twitter, but I checked and they were on Bluesky and Threads. So I promoted it there. Companies used to do this kind of promotion on Twitter and Instagram. It&rsquo;s nice to see them active on Bluesky and Threads.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see social media evolving and changing. Hopefully, we can keep the momentum going and continue to move toward better, healthier online communities.</p>

<p>Another busy week. I feel like a broken record at this point. The kids' schedules are busy. We went to the South Carolina State Fair. I was thankful that I didn&rsquo;t have class this week for Fall Break, but I&rsquo;ve still got a bunch of grad school deadlines to handle. We are actively looking to buy a car ‚Äî which is a process I do <em>not</em> enjoy. It&rsquo;s all quite overwhelming, but we manage to figure out how to fit it all in.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to add this weekly feature to my Now page to encourage me to take and share more pictures. We went to the State Fair to see my daughter&rsquo;s papier-m√¢ch√© giraffe. While I was there, I caught this Ferris wheel against an impossibly blue sky.</p>

<p>Tough week to summarize. It was a challenging week for several reasons. Work wasn&rsquo;t great. We were busy at home. Running constantly.

			 <p>Many years ago, I was having coffee with a successful designer. We were discussing career challenges and he just offhandedly commented ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt love design any more. In fact, I‚Äôm thinking about winding down my business.‚Äù I was still a pretty young and ambitious designer and left the meeting stunned. How could a successful designer get to this point?</p>
<p>Fast forward to about six months ago. My oldest is in college and took a digital art class‚Ä¶ basically the first design class. She did really well and thought about changing her major to graphic design, but she didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do what you do.‚Äù In fact, all of my kids are incredibly artistic, and none of them want to be designers. I shared this observation to my wife, who matter of factly commented ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt love design. You haven‚Äôt for a long time. They‚Äôve watched you. Why would they be excited about it?‚Äù</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was in a work meeting and I found myself far more interested in data and far less interested in creative execution. I was thinking about all the different ways I could study a problem and understand it better.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been in graduate school for what seems like an eternity.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I went back to school to get a Master‚Äôs degree and fell in love with research. Specifically research surrounding design and visual communication. Mostly quantitative analysis. I‚Äôve written journal articles and conference presentations. I finished my MA and rolled right into Ph.D. work. Grad school is literally what I choose to do in my ‚Äúspare‚Äù time. It‚Äôs a grind and sometimes, it‚Äôs overwhelming, but I love it.</p>
<p>There are still aspects of design that I enjoy. I love <a href="https://sbbfonts.com">creating typefaces</a> and working on personal projects. Many of the things that made me a successful designer ‚Äî asking questions, identifying problems and crafting creative solutions ‚Äî are the same skills that I use as a researcher. Career wise, I‚Äôm still a creative director and designer, but the passion for the craft isn‚Äôt there like it used to be. I just don‚Äôt love design anymore.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm at peace with this revelation, but it‚Äôs a strangely emotional moment when you realize that the career you‚Äôve built over the last 27+ years no longer fits you.</p>

<p>This week provided confirmation of how bad Hurricane Helene devastated the people and places that we love in Asheville. We&rsquo;ve heard from all of our friends and they are fine, but the destruction is almost incomprehensible. Asheville is a 2 hour drive from our house, and we make day trips up there all the time. Many of the stores, restaurants and spots we visit are quite simply gone. Lutheridge ‚Äî a camp very special to my family ‚Äî is okay, but with a lot of damage. The pen store in Biltmore Village is destroyed. So is the little bakery next door with the amazing Ginger cookies and the restaurant across the street with the pea salad that my wife loves. It&rsquo;s hard to process all the loss.</p>
<h3 id="feels">Feels</h3>
<ul>
<li>Off balance. Last week was a dance of improvisation. School schedules were changing and shifting, normal rhythms interrupted. But still thankful that our family and house are fine.</li>
<li>Busy weekend. Ryan had his first lacrosse game of the season and it went well. Jill had her homecoming dance. We&rsquo;ll be at the coffee shop later to work on homework.</li>
<li>Where has this year gone? How is it already October?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Still doing pretty well with my diet. Still on track for my goals. Giving myself a year to get healthy was a good plan, but it&rsquo;s hard to stay motivated over such a long span of time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Didn&rsquo;t really make much progress on projects this week.</li>
<li>Got a revise and resubmit with minor changes this week. Excited to see this work get published.</li>

<ul>
<li>Didn&rsquo;t watch any college football this weekend. Which means I missed my Gamecocks struggling against Ole Miss. And Vandy&rsquo;s shocking upset against Alabama.</li>

			 <p>Just found out that my favorite pen store in Asheville, <a href="https://www.origamiink.com">Origami Ink</a>, was completely destroyed in the flood. I assumed that was the case because they were located in Biltmore Village, but the owners posted an update today confirming the sad news. Such nice people. I&rsquo;m devastated for them.</p>

		<a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/09/29/parker-b-my.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-09-29 20:16:06 -0500">Sep 29, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My dad texted me one afternoon that he‚Äôd found some fountain pens at a local auction and asked if I wanted to bid on them. He‚Äôs shared links in the past and I‚Äôve never seen anything that looked interesting. From the look of the pictures, most of the listings looked well worn. But one of the pens was actually in the original packaging ‚Äî a Parker 25B. It was impossible to tell what condition the pen was in, but I decided to take a shot on it. Dad placed a $7 bid. And won.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>When I got the pen, it was in great shape. The package contained two dried up ink cartridges and a squeeze converter.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The pen had been used ‚Äî there was dried up black ink in the feed ‚Äî but I was able to clean it up fairly easily. I inserted a modern Parker black ‚ÄúQuink‚Äù cartridge<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and the pen started writing immediately.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Parker 25 was an entry level metal pen that the company introduced in 1975 and sold until the late 1990s. My new acquisition was a Parker 25B, a matte black version that was only sold between 1979 and 1983. The body of the pen is a little bit thinner than many of my favorite pens with a stepped down section at the back that allows the cap to be securely posted while writing. Apparently <a href="https://www.moreengineering.co.uk/models">the matte black finish can be easily damaged</a>, but the surface of this pen looks like it‚Äôs barely been used.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The nib section is simple and beautiful, with no markings to indicate what thickness it is. The 25B was only available in a fine or medium nib, and this one writes like a medium nib.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Parker 25 was designed to look modern and that‚Äôs how Parker marketed the pen. <a href="https://www.moreengineering.co.uk/publicationsandprices?lightbox=dataItem-kv7pelim1">In one ad, they referred to the pen as ‚ÄúSpace Age Design.‚Äù</a> One major shift from traditional Parker pens was the <a href="https://www.moreengineering.co.uk/history">clip design</a> ‚Äî squared off with a Parker badge on it instead of the traditional Parker arrow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The pen is stamped ‚ÄúMade in England,‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know what year this pen was manufactured in. Many Parkers have year codes etched into them, but I can‚Äôt find one on my 25B. Given that it was only manufactured between 1979 and 1983, I know the pen is between 41-45 years old.</p>
<p>Bidding on this pen was a gamble because we couldn‚Äôt inspect it in person. I‚Äôve been intimidated by vintage pens, worried that I‚Äôd overpay or get something that doesn‚Äôt work. My dad loves these kinds of auctions and has been looking for pens for several years. This is the first I felt good about. If you are interested in picking up a vintage pen like this, my best advice is to be patient and know what you are looking for.</p>
<p>My Parker 25B writes beautifully and fits my preference for modernist fountain pen designs. I haven‚Äôt decided if I‚Äôm going to add it to my daily carry yet, or just use it at home. But I‚Äôm thrilled that I have it in my collection and look forward to using it.</p>

<p>Hurricane Helene hit us in Columbia, South Carolina this week. Early Friday morning, we lost power with 60+ mph wind gusts. Trees down everywhere. In Columbia, we weren&rsquo;t prepared for a storm of this magnitude. We got power back 12 hours later, but many people in the area are still without power.</p>
<p>As bad as it was here, it was much, much worse two hours north in Asheville. Western North Carolina is devastated. Asheville is in many ways a second home and it&rsquo;s heartbreaking to see the devastation and flooding.</p>
<h3 id="feels">Feels</h3>

<li>Grateful that our family is fine, our house is undamaged, and we have power.</li>

<p>A draining week and weekend. Not bad, but exhausting. I almost forgot to post my weekly update. We celebrated Jill&rsquo;s 17th birthday this weekend. (Her actual birthday is next week.)

			 <p>Red Lobster has been struggling through financial troubles for a while and the chain is the process of being sold. Today, they announced that <a href="https://www.thestate.com/living/food-drink/article291478465.html#storylink=mainstage_lead">the location closest to me in Cayce, South Carolina has closed.</a> I‚Äôve eaten at that Red Lobster once in the last five years and it was an unmitigated disaster. We waited forever for a table and the food wasn‚Äôt great.</p>
<p>But my grandparents and parents loved Red Lobster. There is a Red Lobster in Aiken that my grandparents always took us to. While I was in college, we had many family dinners at the Cayce Red Lobster. I think we went there after I graduated from college. When Liz and I got married, we lived in Cayce, and sometimes, you want some fried shrimp and Cheddar Bay Biscuits after church.</p>
<p>Alas, I won‚Äôt miss my local Red Lobster, but I am sad to see it go.</p>

			 <p>My daughter has gotten us all into F1. Jill&rsquo;s become a hard core McLaren fan. My wife seems to have settled into cheering for George Russell and Mercedes. Ryan is a Max Verstappen fan.</p>
<p>As for me, I tend to be pulling for McLaren. Which causes a problem. Their color is papaya&hellip; which is orange.</p>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t do orange.</strong> As a South Carolina Gamecocks fan, orange is the color of all of our rivals&hellip; from in-state Clemson to SEC foes Florida and Tennessee. (And I&rsquo;m not just a SC fan, I&rsquo;m also manage the schools visual branding.)</p>
<p>Jill&rsquo;s convinced herself that papaya and Clemson orange are different colors. She&rsquo;s decked out in papaya right now celebrating Lando&rsquo;s Dutch Grand Prix victory. She&rsquo;s right ‚Äì the colors <em>are</em> different ‚Äì but it&rsquo;s still tough for me. We&rsquo;ll see if I come around to McLaren papaya, or if I continue my orange ban.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing how Lando and Oscar do in the Italy Grand Prix next weekend.</p>

<li>Our oldest, Norah, moved into her own apartment this week. And while she lived in the residence hall last year, she&rsquo;s now really out on her own. Proud of her, but it&rsquo;s always a little bittersweet to watch the kids grow up.</li>
<li>Back to heading to the coffee shop to work every weekend with my daughter. She has so much AP work to do, that she likes to go to Starbucks to study. I usually have work to do, too. So we go together. I don&rsquo;t love the stress that comes with the work, but I adore having the time with Jill.</li>
<li>Continue to be both nervous and excited about the future of this country. I think the wild swings in the news cycle affect me more than I&rsquo;d like to admit.</li>

<p>I celebrated my 49th birthday this week. My kids have an annual tradition where they bake a cake for me, usually with a high degree of difficulty. This year, they attempted to make a Borg Cube from Star Trek.</p>
<p>As I turn 49, I‚Äôm looking ahead to 50 next year. I‚Äôve decided that I want to be healthier at 50 than I was at 40. I need to loose weight, eat better and be more active. Basically a lifestyle change. I‚Äôm going to add a health category to my weekly Now page updates.</p>
<p>Still wondering if I should post these on Sundays instead of Saturdays.</p>

<li>One of my friends is leaving for a job at another school. I‚Äôm bummed, but it‚Äôs a great opportunity for her. Just a lot of changes at the office this summer.</li>
<li>I continue to be impressed with Kamala Harris‚Äôs campaign so far. I forgot what hope felt like.</li>

<p>Just had a relaxing week of vacation with just my wife and me. The kids were at summer camp for the week so we decided to celebrate our 25th anniversary early up near Asheville. We had a great time, but it‚Äôs going to be hard going back to reality on Monday.</p>
<h3 id="feels">Feels</h3>

<li>I feel refreshed. I really needed to take some time off from work and reset. With the leadership change at work, I think I needed the break more than I realized.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm worried about the state of our nation, but I‚Äôm energized by the change in the presidential race. Biden stepping down, and Harris consolidating support has me encouraged.</li>
<li>Being open to changes. The camp our kids went to is also the camp that I attended and worked at. They changed pick up this year, ending on Friday instead of Saturday morning. I wasn‚Äôt sure about the change, but we attended a new final ceremony and it was great. I probably need to make this a full post, but we all need to accept that sometimes, change is needed.</li>

			 <h2 id="choosing-our-words-carefully">Choosing our words carefully</h2>
<p><a href="https://bobwertz.com/2019/01/13/captive-social-vs.html">I wrote a blog post in early 2019</a>, trying to make a distinction between ‚Äúopen‚Äù social platforms that thrived on interoperability compared to ‚Äúcaptive‚Äù networks that trap you in their system. As an aside, I also noted the difference between ‚Äúindie‚Äù social and ‚Äúopen‚Äù social and added this footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recognize that the concept of an open social network from a large corporation might seem absurd in today‚Äôs environment, but you never know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five years later, we have Threads, a <em>somewhat</em> open social network from a large corporation with a track record of building toxic captive networks. The word ‚Äúopen‚Äù in this case is distinct from ‚Äúindie,‚Äù since no one can <em>ever</em> claim that Meta is a small independent company. But in the case of Threads, they do seem to be moving toward being more open.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs important to make a distinction, between open and captive social networks, but also between open and indie networks.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Our goal should be interoperability between our networks. The indie web is a big part of this effort, driving the technology and the open social philosophy forward. But I believe it‚Äôs going to take some of the large players truly adopting open social protocols to make true interoperability a reality.</p>
<p>These layers are all complicated, and how we talk about it matters, especially when talking with less tech savvy audiences. As advocates for interoperability online, I think we need to do a better job communicating how our goals will benefit everyone. Using accessible language is a big part of that effort.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, I knew the owner was conservative, but it didn&rsquo;t really matter to me. I&rsquo;d randomly order stickers (or keychains) whenever they had a great special. And they ran specials a lot.</p>
<p>Many companies take stands on issues as a way to signal their values. But most of the time, those topics are carefully chosen to align with their customer beliefs. There is an entire discipline in public relations scholarship called Corporate Social Responsibility that studies this strategy.</p>
<p>But this crosses a line. Blasting your entire business mailing list with a political message ‚Äî a mailing list that is a massive asset to your sales funnel ‚Äî is just stupid.</p>
<p>Why? You are choosing to voluntarily spam your mailing list with a political message that half of your list likely finds objectionable. Look at the last two presidential elections. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Over half of the U.S. voted against him. Twice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And add to that the nerve of trying to use an attempted assassination to sell shirts. Incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Anyway, I unsubscribed. I&rsquo;ve got a Sticker Mule sticker on a water bottle that I&rsquo;ll cover up. I&rsquo;ll find another vendor and he&rsquo;s apparently got plenty of business from people that agree with him.</p>

<p>Good week, although still way too hot in Columbia, South Carolina. To be fair, it‚Äôs too hot pretty much everywhere, it seems. I‚Äôve stolen a brilliant idea from <a href="https://dahlstrand.net/">Sven Dahlstrand (@sod on Micro.Blog)</a> and I‚Äôm going to archive my previous ‚ÄúNow‚Äù pages on blog in <a href="https://bobwertz.com/categories/then/">a category called ‚ÄúThen.‚Äù</a> I like to have an archive of everything and it always bothered me that my Now page implementation didn‚Äôt have a history.</p>
<h3 id="feels">Feels</h3>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm tired. It‚Äôs been a long week for some reason.</li>
<li>Looking forward to an upcoming vacation.</li>
<li>Sad that summer is coming to an end. Kids start school in less than a month. The excessive heat has been brutal this year. We are fortunate to have shelter and air conditioning so we can manage, but I haven‚Äôt felt like leaving the house. Ready for cooler weather.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm getting closer to finishing a couple of new fonts to make available on MyFonts. Just need to put the finishing touches on the files and marketing images.</li>
<li>I spent time this week editing my paper on consumer attitudes toward logos. Happy with the edits. Time to submit it to a journal. We‚Äôll see what happens.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Star Trek: Prodigy on Netflix. Finished watching the series this week. Liked where the story landed and was genuinely surprised by some of the callbacks and references to previous Trek franchises.</li>
<li>Star Wars: The Acolyte. Finale this week. I‚Äôve enjoyed the show, and like the idea that they are telling the story in an earlier time period. I‚Äôll probably post longer thoughts on the blog after the finale.</li>
<li>Looking for books for vacation and realized the last book in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CJGBVJGK?ref_=dbs_p_pwh_rwt_cpsb_cl_2&amp;storeType=ebooks">Rebecca Roanhorse‚Äôs Between Earth and Sky series</a> is out. I thought I‚Äôd preordered it, but apparently not. Need to go back and reread the last book to remember where they left things. Looking forward to reading the final book of the trilogy on vacation.</li>
<li>No F1 this week.</li>

			 <p>I know that enclosed shopping malls have fallen out of fashion, but I‚Äôm of an age where malls played a major role in my childhood. An abandoned mall in Columbia is being torn down and I was thinking today about all the malls that have played a role in my life. I figured I‚Äôd share a couple of memories of malls that are no more‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Richland Fashion Mall.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The mall that‚Äôs being torn down is in Forest Acres, South Carolina. I drove past it today so I‚Äôll start with this one. Being close to the University of South Carolina campus and my first apartment, I took a bunch of trips to Richland Fashion Mall.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> We occasionally visited the movie theater on the rooftop before nicer theaters came to Columbia. Liz and I frequented the Barnes and Noble when we were dating and registered for our china at the Dillards when we got engaged. Liz even got her hair done at the Belk‚Äôs salon for a few years. Lots of good memories, but the mall had been pretty much abandoned for years and <a href="https://www.forestacres.net/economic-development/richland-mall-be-demolished">it‚Äôs good to see the redevelopment <em>finally</em> starting with the demolition of the old structure.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dutch Square Mall.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> We lived in Illinois when I was in elementary school, but our family was still in South Carolina so we‚Äôd travel down twice a year to see everyone. One reliable stop was always Dutch Square Mall in Columbia, South Carolina near the intersection of I-26 and I-20. Back when Chick-fi-A was only in the South and only in mall food courts, this was an easy option for some delicious chicken sandwiches. Cromer‚Äôs Peanuts had a location in the mall where we could buy bags of boiled peanuts and see some monkeys.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (I‚Äôm pretty sure my parents wanted to wear us out before we got to my grandparent‚Äôs house about an hour away.) Much later, the mall was renovated to have a 14-theater movie theater and the Dutch Square Theater became our go-to theater. I saw countless movies there including a midnight showing of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. With the opening of nearby Columbiana Mall, shoppers and retailers moved to the trendy new spot. Years later, I worked at an insurance company nearby and would occasionally run over to the Chick-fil-A, but it was clear by then that the mall was slowly dying and AMC closed the theater. The mall is actually still open and the movie theater is operated by a small chain now, but there‚Äôs not much out there any more. <a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/local/article278225953.html">A nearby church is in the process of purchasing it and has plans to completely redevelop it.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aiken Mall.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This mall in Aiken, SC opened right as I started high school. For a small town, it was a big deal. It had a bunch of undersized anchor stores, but it also had everything a teenage me needed: an arcade, a Babbage‚Äôs video game store, a B. Dalton bookstore and a music store. My mom had us get family portraits taken at the Sears Portrait Studio many, many times. My car broke down in the parking lot at least once. As anchor stores JC Penny, Sears and Phar-Mor started to close, they tried to reconfigure it a couple of times, but the mall was already in a death spiral. At some point, they added a Books-a-Million and my in-laws would take our children there when they were babysitting. Redevelopment was promised for years, but they‚Äôve finally torn most of it down and have started building a mixed-use development. <a href="https://www.wjbf.com/top-stories/former-aiken-mall-property-has-new-name-and-making-progress/">Apparently, a Chicken Salad Chick will be opening soon in the new development.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these locations are finally being redeveloped and I&rsquo;m really happy about that, but as a kid that grew up in the 1980s and 1990s, these old hangouts will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>

			 <p>I was thinking this week about how Micro.Blog has become the home base for all of my online activity. I&rsquo;ve had an account since I backed the Kickstarter in 2017, but recently, I‚Äôve started slowly moving everything from my old Squarespace<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> site:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blog Hosting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This blog is hosted on Micro.Blog. I‚Äôm in the process of migrating my favorite old posts from Sketchbook B here so everything is in one place. At the $10/month premium subscription level, I can even add a few more blogs if I want to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Site Hosting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <a href="http://sbbfonts.com">SbBFonts.com</a> is a static site hosted on Micro.Blog that features my typeface designs. I‚Äôve got other ideas for simple sites I want to build. These &ldquo;single page sites&rdquo; are completely underrated feature of Micro.Blog and included with the premium plan. I love the flexibility of adding these kind of sites quickly and easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Social timeline.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I use Micro.Blog‚Äôs timeline to interact with other Micro.Blog users and to follow Mastodon and other Fediverse accounts. It‚Äôs not the most active timeline because there is no algorithm pushing content at you. I consider that a feature, not a drawback. It&rsquo;s not a replacement for other social sites like Mastodon, Threads or Bluesky, but it is a nice alternative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crossposting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Social media is fragmenting. When I post to Micro.Blog, I have it configured to automatically crosspost to Bluesky and Threads. I could also crosspost to LinkedIn, but I don‚Äôt want everything I post copied over there. People on Mastodon can follow my Micro.Blog posts at <a href="mailto:bobwertz@bobwertz.com">bobwertz@bobwertz.com</a>. And the service keeps evolving. Micro.Blog founder <a href="https://www.manton.org">Manton Reese</a> is great about adding features as new APIs are released or updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Tweet Archive.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Just because I left Twitter didn‚Äôt mean I wanted to lose all my tweets. Manton built a way to import my tweets and I now have a <a href="https://bobwertz.com/tweets/">searchable archive of 15 years of Twitter posts</a> on my own site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Third-party Tools.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The web interface for Micro.Blog is fine, but I like using different apps, too. I can post directly to Micro.Blog from <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> and <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> has a nice little integration, too, but I don‚Äôt use it much. It‚Äôs nice to have options, something that Squarespace doesn‚Äôt offer.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other features that I don‚Äôt take advantage of yet like email newsletters, podcasts and narrated posts. All of these are included with my plan, I just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to using them yet.</p>
<hr>
<p>I know that Micro.Blog isn‚Äôt for everyone. It‚Äôs easy to get started, but to get maximum customization, you need to be comfortable with tinkering. The text editor uses <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which I like, but many people have never heard of. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Micro.Blog has no built in metrics. This is by design and I think it&rsquo;s a good thing, but if you are the type of person who wants to dig into the metrics of every post, this probably isn&rsquo;t the service for you.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Micro.Blog is exactly what I want in a service. A home for all of my random thoughts, projects and experiments. The service provides an incredible amount of value for $5 or $10 a month and it feels like the web I fell in love with. If it aligns with your needs, there really isn&rsquo;t a better service.</p>

<p>Squarespace seems to be trying to serve a business audience with a ton of features that I really don&rsquo;t need.

<p>I wrote a post in <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2016/11/09/twitterless.html">2016</a> asking how I would deal with the inevitable demise of Twitter. And followed up with posts in <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2018/01/03/twitterless-part-ii.html">2018</a>, <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/07/twitterless-part-iii.html">2022</a> and <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2023/07/25/twitterless-the-final.html">2023</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In each of the post, one common refrain kept resurfacing. There is no equal for following a live event on Twitter. The last month or so, there have been several events in tech and sports that I would have followed closely on Twitter.</p>
<p>You know what? I didn‚Äôt miss Twitter at all.</p>
<p>Instead, I stuck with Micro.Blog and Threads. On Micro.Blog, I follow not only other Micro.Blog users, but I also follow a number of Mastodon users who I previously followed on Twitter. Most of those people are journalists or experts who I do not know personally. On Threads, I follow mostly people that I know personally, many of whom have common interests. These two services combined provided everything I needed. I didn&rsquo;t even think about logging back into Twitter.</p>
<p>Finally, I‚Äôm baffled by friends who remain active on Twitter despite everything that Musk has said and done. They seem addicted to their ‚Äúaudience‚Äù and are scared to lose ‚Äúengagement.‚Äù There are other options and it‚Äôs time to move on. The sooner you start building a new audience, the sooner you can leave Twitter.</p>

			 <p>I decided a while back that I wanted to separate my typeface designs onto their own site. They‚Äôve always lived alongside my blog and other creative projects, but they needed a home of their own, especially since I plan to expand the offerings in the near future. I‚Äôve been noodling around with options, but today, I‚Äôm finally ready to release <a href="https://www.sbbfonts.com">SbBFonts.com</a> out into the world with a design inspired by two-color printing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-inspiration">The Inspiration</h3>
<p>When I became a designer in the mid-1990s, the web was just becoming a thing, and printed documents were the primary job of a designer. Two-color projects used only two spot ink colors ‚Äî say green and black ‚Äî for the entire job. (You also had a ‚Äúthird‚Äù color with the paper, which was usually just white.) Four-color printing or full-color printing was reserved for only the most important pieces with the largest budgets. For young designers in a pre-web world, two-color work paid the bills. Two-color printing presented challenges, but the process had a particular look. Designers who knew what they were doing could use duotones for images or print on colored paper to get a different look.</p>
<p>Two-color printing isn‚Äôt dead. Screen printing and letterpress still use spot colors, but full color printing has gotten cheaper and as a society, we don‚Äôt print nearly as many marketing materials as we used to. The craft of designing has moved past the lowly two-color press run.</p>
<p>I guess that‚Äôs why when I started to design a home for my typeface designs, I knew I wanted the site to resemble a two-color print job. Much of the inspiration for my type designs comes from my nostalgia for old tech. Two-color printing seemed like the perfect inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="the-execution">The Execution</h3>
<p>The first question was what two &ldquo;ink&rdquo; colors to use? Since I wanted to use a dark background, I chose white and the bright green since I use that color for all of my Sketchbook B projects. I picked two dark greens to be backgrounds ‚Äî essentially a dark mode and a darker mode.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Accommodating the two background colors meant that I also needed to use transparency on all of my example graphics, including my fake ‚Äúduotones‚Äù and my animated GIFs. You can see the example below of one of the images I used placed over white, dark green and darker green backgrounds. I‚Äôm happy with the result, even if there are far easier ways to accomplish this look.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This site is hosted as a ‚Äúsingle page‚Äù on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.Blog</a>. This might be the worst named feature on Micro.Blog since you can absolutely have more than one page. It‚Äôs simply a static Hugo site that doesn‚Äôt include a blog. I built everything on the <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog">Tiny theme by Matt Langford</a> ‚Äî the same version that I use for <a href="https://www.bobwertz.com">bobwertz.com</a>. This feature is included in my Micro.Blog subscription, so my additional cost is essentially nothing.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>To get the look I wanted, I had to write a bunch of HTML and CSS. My old site was on Squarespace, so it has been a while since I worked so closely with markup. I spent a good bit of time digging through reference guides to make sure I was doing everything correctly. But honestly, if you look under the hood, it‚Äôs probably a mess. Just a warning.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I still have a little refinement left, but I‚Äôm happy with where the site is. I need to finish proofreading and rework some of the copy. I&rsquo;m thinking about future development&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got a plan on how to change the home page when I add a few more typefaces. Right now, I think the five fonts currently presented in this way is about the maximum.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://www.sbbfonts.com">SbB Fonts</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I realized this morning that I‚Äôve been using Fontstruct for 15 years. Fontstruct is an online tool for building modular typefaces. My first typeface design ‚Äî Big Thursday ‚Äî debuted on May 26, 2009. Since then, <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/154783/sketchbook_b">I‚Äôve publicly released 49 fonts on Fontstruct</a> and 19 have been selected as ‚ÄúStaff Picks.‚Äù</p>
<p>The original version didn‚Äôt have a lot of flexibility,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but over time developer Rob Meek has added new brick types, construction methods, kerning, support for color fonts and other features to Fontstruct to make it more powerful. My work tends to be a little brutalist, but if you want to understand the flexibility of the tool, check out <a href="https://fontstruct.com/gallery?filters=staff-picks-only&amp;order=by-balanced-rating">the gallery</a> to see what amazing creations people can craft with this online tool.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt use the most complicated features, but I sometimes use Fontstruct to prototype an idea for a new typeface. One of Fontstruct‚Äôs best integrations is that I can download a file that I can open and refine in Glyphs.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I recently created a design, moved it to Glyphs and built a variable font out of it.</p>
<p>Balancing work, family, grad school and other obligations, I don‚Äôt have a ton of time to spend in Fontstruct. But when they rolled out the Patron level of support for 5 euro a month, I subscribed immediately. I‚Äôm happy to support independent tools that are constantly improving.</p>
<p>I pulled together a sample of some of the designs I&rsquo;ve created over the years on Fontstruct. Feel free to <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/154783/sketchbook_b">head over to my page</a> and download anything you like. Or better yet, sign up for an account and start experimenting.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I started a blog in early 2008. Over the years, I wrote hundreds of posts and articles. Some of it good. Much of it forgettable. I authored a bunch of InDesign tips that generated search traffic, but over time, I became less interested in writing about Adobe Creative Cloud and design issues. A few years ago, I moved all my writing over to this site. As part of some work I‚Äôm doing this summer to clean up my various sites, <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/05/19/reading-back-over.html">I wanted to figure out how to save the posts from this old Squarespace site.</a></p>
<p>I tried to export the entire archive, but had limited success. The Squarespace export uses the Wordpress export format. And the export kinda works, but Squarespace‚Äôs software has inserted random code blocks throughout that would have to be removed manually. I thought about just shutting down the whole blog, but changed my mind. As I scanned over the list of articles, there were too many posts that I didn‚Äôt want to lose.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/05/19/reading-back-over.html">earlier post</a>, a friend of mine (who also happened to have an old Squarespace site) mentioned that he moved selected posts manually to a new site, and let go of the stuff he no longer focused on. The more I looked at my old writing, the more this seemed like the logical path forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that I‚Äôm going to slowly move selected posts to bobwertz.com. Several of them were written at a particular time, about specific events so I‚Äôve decided to post them on the new site with the original date. I‚Äôve added a sentence at the top, to explain that the post has been moved. I‚Äôll make minor grammar or spelling corrections, but otherwise I plan to leave the posts as they are now.</p>
<p>As a test, I‚Äôve moved two posts already: <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2015/05/14/bare-bad-acronyms.html">B.A.R.E. (Bad Acronyms aRe Everywhere)</a> from 2015 and <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2018/01/07/i-made-a.html">I made a red velvet cake</a> from 2018. I‚Äôve got about 70 posts that I want to move, and I plan to move a couple of posts each week.</p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs worth noting that one of the reasons I feel comfortable moving everything to Micro.Blog is Manton‚Äôs commitment to ensuring the content you create can easily be moved, archived or backed up. I‚Äôve turned on Micro.Blog‚Äôs Github backup feature, and I know I can export my content in a number of formats if I need to, including the <a href="https://indieweb.org/blog_archive_format">blog archive format</a> that Manton proposed. I wish more services realized the value of allowing easy export of content, and I‚Äôm appreciative of Micro.Blog‚Äôs commitment to portability and interoperability.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with this solution and even though it will take time to move the posts manually, I truly believe it&rsquo;s the best option for this situation.</p>

Now that court filings are beginning, our local paper has details and it&rsquo;s somehow worse than I thought. Nauseating. It&rsquo;s a strange feeling to have worked with someone 15 years ago and see them in the papers accused of truly horrific behavior. Were they that monstrous when we worked together? Probably.

			 <p>Several years ago, I moved all of my blog posting from my Squarespace-hosted sketchbookb.com to my Micro.Blog-hosted bobwertz.com. I‚Äôve been happy with the move. My plan was to switch my Squarespace blog over to more professional posts, but that never really happened ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt really feel like posting more InDesign and Creative Cloud tips. Last week, I decided that I need to do something with the old site and I‚Äôm working through my options.</p>
<p>One of the options was just to bring the site down and redirect sketchbookb.com to a new site. I‚Äôve got over 600 posts, though, and while most of them don‚Äôt see any traffic, I‚Äôd hate to see them all disappear. I started to go back through the site to see what I‚Äôd lose.</p>
<p>My first post is in 2008 and my last post was at the end of 2021. There are many tips and tricks for InDesign that generate significant traffic even though they are very old. I also have a large number of reviews for iPhone apps that no longer exist. I wouldn‚Äôt miss those posts, but reading back through my writing, there is much that I do not want to part with. A reflection about being on a beach on a moonless night. My series of Twitterless posts and a handful of somewhat prescient rants about social media. My 52 Shirts project. New typeface introductions. Writing about our COVID reality. My original attempt at hosting my microblogging on Sketchbook B. My successful attempt to bake my mom‚Äôs red velvet cake recipe.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So what should I do? I‚Äôm not going to delete Sketchbook B without saving the posts somehow. I have first drafts of most of the writing in Ulysses, the app where I‚Äôve done most of my writing for almost a decade.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But the final posts often have custom illustrations or additional copy edits, so the Ulysses version is somewhat incomplete. I‚Äôve experimented with trying to export and move the posts from Squarespace, but that hasn‚Äôt gone well. One of my friends recommended saving the posts that matter to me and moving them manually to bobwertz.com. That would work for some of the posts, but it would be a tedious process. A couple of them ‚Äî like my examination on viewscreens and interfaces in Star Trek ‚Äî really could be updated. I may start updating and reposting select articles to bobwertz.com and just add a note to the beginning about when and where they were originally posted. We‚Äôll see how that goes.</p>
<p>I will still try to move them to another site. I have a full backup of my tweets, and I‚Äôd love to have Sketchbook B as well. The problem is that Squarespace exports using the Wordpress format, but they have some extra code in the export that causes problems.</p>
<p>Finally, the print designer part of me wants to pull together all the posts that matter and make a physical book. Place a copy on my bookshelf. It seems appropriate as a way to close an old chapter and start a new one.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I‚Äôm noticing a tension growing between national organizations and their local affiliates. Just three recent examples that have crossed my path:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was once an AIGA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> chapter president and stepped down to go back to graduate school, but I was also <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/14/its-time-for.html">disillusioned with the mission and how the national organization treated its chapters.</a> Now AIGA National is struggling with finances and relevance, while member‚Äôs loyalty (and all the value of the membership) is tied up at the local level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Churches are going through the same thing. When the massive Methodist church near us left the denomination, they didn‚Äôt join one of the new organizations. They essentially became a non-denominational church. And pointed out in the news article that they get to keep all of the money they used to send to the churchwide organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organizers of the local NaNoWriMo<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> group in our area became frustrated with the national organization, and essentially became an independent writing support group. They were running a year-round organization anyway, and didn‚Äôt see the need for the national organization. Their Facebook group wiped all mention of NaNoWriMo</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>National organizations were once necessary to provide credibility, structure and support. Local organizations could provide local services and the relationship was mutually beneficial. Over time, that equation has shifted. Less value is provided by the national organization. Loyalties are with the local clubs, churches or groups. If the local leadership and the national leadership disagree, the local leadership has the leverage to take their organization independent. And in many cases, that seems like it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I do think there is value in national organizations, but organizations like AIGA need to better understand what value they bring to the table and strike a new balance with their local partners. Or risk becoming irrelevant.</p>

			 <h2 id="an-incredibly-strange-accident-but-my-wife-and-son-are-fine">An incredibly strange accident, but my wife and son are fine.</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Two weeks ago, Liz and Ryan were driving to school early in the morning in a midst of a rain storm when a pine tree blew into their path and impaled their 2020 Buick Envision. The tree was about 24 feet tall, passed through the headlight, through the engine, through the firewall, through the dashboard and extended several feet into the passenger cabin, between the front headrests.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By some miracle, Liz needed only four stitches on her hand, caused by a ring that had to be cut off her thumb. And my 12-year-old son, who was in the front passenger seat, was completely untouched. Numerous people from firefighters and policemen to tow truck drivers and insurance adjusters have said they‚Äôve never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>After people processes the shock of the accident, and the relief that everyone is okay, most people look at the picture of the interior and have the same reaction: ‚ÄúWait, why didn‚Äôt the airbags deploy?‚Äù</p>
<p>The airbags did not deploy. And <em>everyone</em> has a theory about why.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theory #1: The airbags didn‚Äôt deploy because they failed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The airbags should have deployed, but must have been defective. Most people who believe this want me to share a picture of the damage with Buick and complain. ‚ÄúThey should have to compensate you‚Äù is a common refrain. &ldquo;You should sue.&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theory #2: The airbags didn‚Äôt deploy because the tree missed the sensors.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This theory was floated by the tow truck operator. Because the tree went through the headlight where there are no airbag sensors, the airbags didn‚Äôt deploy. In this scenario, the headlights are essentially a weakness in the car‚Äôs safety design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theory #3: The airbags worked as designed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> They should not have gone off because the accident wasn‚Äôt a typical head on collision. The car was immediately spun around in a lateral motion. The physics of the accident were weird and disorienting. It‚Äôs worth noting that my wife‚Äôs iPhone‚Äôs crash detection didn‚Äôt trigger either despite the fact that it was thrown to the floor from the center console. Several people have theorized that the force of the airbags could have made injuries worse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My gut reaction is that the airbags behaved as designed, but I also could understand if the car wasn‚Äôt engineered to withstand such a strange, one-in-a-million accident.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the thing, though. I don‚Äôt know how airbag systems work. Most people don‚Äôt, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped us all from speculating. We imagine the airbag systems in modern cars to be this protective cloud that inflates around us, but I know it‚Äôs more complicated than that. We want to know why the airbags didn‚Äôt deploy because we want to be reassured that if it happens to us, we‚Äôll be safe. But it‚Äôs just not that simple. There are too many variables.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll never know why the airbags didn‚Äôt deploy, but Liz and Ryan are lucky to be alive and I‚Äôm incredibly thankful for that.</p>

		<a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/04/22/buffy-the-vampire.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-04-22 21:00:41 -0500">Apr 22, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I watched a couple of my favorite episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer tonight. The show was once one of my favorites and creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> could do no wrong. I loved Buffy, Firefly, The Avengers and Dr. Horrible‚Äôs Sing-Along Blog. I even watched Agents of SHIELD. But eventually, it came to light that Joss wasn‚Äôt the feminist he claimed to be, repeatedly cheated on his wife, and verbally abused many of the people he worked with, especially Charisma Carpenter.</p>
<p>Chocolate Cake for Breakfast is one of my favorite stand up routines. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby">Bill Cosby‚Äôs</a> family-inspired standup ‚Äî long before the Cosby Show ‚Äî was hilarious. But later in life, he was credibly accused of drugging and sexually assaulting several women.</p>
<p>Gill Sans is a legendary typeface, created by author, artist and typographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill">Eric Gill</a>. I‚Äôve worked for several companies for which Gill Sans was a key element of their corporate visual identity. But Eric Gill noted in his diary that he had numerous affairs, sexually assaulted two of his daughters&hellip; and his dog.</p>
<p>These are three examples, but they are far from the only examples. Many works of art and entertainment have been created by people who turn out to be despicable. How do you separate the creator from their work? Can you?</p>
<p>For me, I can separate Joss Whedon from Buffy and his other creations. He didn‚Äôt write every word and the show isn‚Äôt just him. The actors, writers, and staff brought the show to life and crafted the characters who I loved so much. But I have to admit that I‚Äôm now less likely to watch old episodes of Buffy, and I no longer hold the show on the pedestal that I once did.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs different for Bill Cosby and Eric Gill, though. Their creations are sole creative endeavors. As much as I might like Cosby‚Äôs old standup routines or Gill Sans, I can‚Äôt separate the creation from the person who created it. I don‚Äôt listen to old Cosby standup, and I don‚Äôt share it with my kids. I don‚Äôt use Gill Sans (or any Eric Gill typefaces) if I can avoid it. If I cite some of Eric Gill‚Äôs writings on typography like <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/03/30/inherent-indestructible-permanent.html">I did a couple of months ago</a>, I include a comment that he was a horrible human being.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I‚Äôm not 100% sure this dichotomy makes sense, treating collaborative works differently than sole creations, but it‚Äôs where I am right now.</p>

			 <p>Almost 100 years ago, in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, typographer Eric Gill <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> wrote ‚ÄúAn Essay on Typography‚Äù and addressed the tension between art and industrialization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúBut tho‚Äô industrialism has now won an almost complete victory, the handicrafts are not killed, &amp; they cannot be quite killed because they meet an inherent, indestructible, permanent need in human nature.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve been thinking about this as the internet fills with AI-generated garbage and popular social media sites are monetized by hate.</p>
<p><em>Inherent. Indestructible. Permanent.</em></p>
<p>While Eric Gill never imagined the internet, I think his statement applies just as much to our modern world as it did in the Industrial Revolution. Much of the internet might become cheaply-produced, AI-generated, SEO-approved content, but people all over the world who care about creativity and writing will still produce great work and share it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably being naive, but I‚Äôm still hopeful that the human need for creativity will overwhelm the capitalistic urge to industrialize content.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Almost 20 years ago, I was in San Francisco for my first AIGA Leadership Retreat. AIGA is a national organization for design<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and I was a first-time president for the South Carolina chapter. I‚Äôd just finished attending a session on leadership and one of my new friends who&rsquo;d been a president before pulled me aside and gave me some advice: ‚ÄúThis is supposed to be fun. If it stops being fun, ask for help. You are giving up a bunch of your free time and if you aren‚Äôt having fun, it‚Äôs not worth it.‚Äù</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been thinking about that advice a lot lately and I‚Äôve come to a realization. Our volunteer ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù have become unpaid part-time jobs. (Maybe they always were‚Ä¶) We are saddled with job descriptions and expectations. We dedicate our time and energy to a cause because we believe in it, but we manage volunteer organizations following the only model we have: business.</p>
<p>I see it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->churches<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who are looking for people to fill roles and run programs to keep the organization functioning.</p>
<p>I see it in our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->professional organizations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, like AIGA, where we expect a level of excellence and professionalism on par with what we would expect from our corporate colleagues.</p>
<p>I see it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->academia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where professors do a massive amount of additional service work in reviewing journal submissions and organizing conferences.</p>
<p>I see it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recreational youth sports<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where people dedicate nights and weekends to coaching kids year-after-year.</p>
<p>I see it in our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->organizational boards<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are increasingly trying to recruit people with particular backgrounds and skill sets to provide professional guidance.</p>
<p>This problem is compounded by how we talk about these volunteer positions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are giving back, <em>not using your free time.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are offering your skills and abilities, <em>not providing free labor that other people would pay you for.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are providing service to the community, <em>not working for free.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We talk about this volunteer jobs more like a calling, not a job. And that makes it so much harder to separate from a position that is overwhelming.</p>
<p>The result of this structure is almost always burnout. Frustration. We often become stuck in our volunteer positions, unable to find someone to take over the incredibly complex structure or programming we have built or maintained. Unsurprisingly, most people ‚Äî even if they care about deeply about an organization or cause ‚Äî are unwilling to step up and commit massive time and energy to a cause when they are already juggling their own jobs and family commitments. The volunteer opportunity that you were excited about is now weighing you down and causing stress and anxiety. It‚Äôs no longer fun.</p>
<p>This situation isn‚Äôt good for the organizations either. After someone manages to escape from a volunteer position, how often does that person significantly decrease their involvement? I can‚Äôt tell you how many people I know who disappear after a long stint on a church council. Or how many former AIGA presidents I know who now have nothing to do with AIGA only a couple of years after their term is over. How many board members step away completely after their service is complete?</p>
<p>The mission of the organization then shifts from serving the community to finding the volunteers to sustain the organization.</p>
<p>We need to rethink volunteer leadership.</p>
<p><strong>The realignment starts at the top.</strong> If the leadership of an organization is overworked and burned out, the other volunteers will assume that‚Äôs normal. Some will try to emulate the behavior. Others will leave knowing they can‚Äôt commit that much. Our presidents, executive directors and other leadership need to model an appropriate work/life/volunteer balance. Working around the clock isn‚Äôt always the long-term, sustainable answer.</p>
<p><strong>We need to spend less time crafting our job descriptions and more time building relationships.</strong> We‚Äôre following the model we know, based on how our business organizations are structured, but I‚Äôm not sure that model works in today‚Äôs volunteer organization. While we need to make sure expectations are clear, we also need to worry less about the business-like hierarchy and spend more energy on engaging our community. Focus on doing good work, aligned with the mission of the organization.</p>
<p><strong>We need to be realistic about what we are asking people to do.</strong> Recruit more people to do smaller jobs instead of asking one person to commit a massive amount of time. Maybe in the past, you recruited one or two people to run an event. Maybe you should instead recruit 5-10 to cover the same amount of work. And if we can‚Äôt find the needed volunteers, it is time to scale back the project or event to be more reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>We need to be thankful for the contributions of others, no matter how small.</strong> Too often, we thank volunteers by presenting them with opportunities to embrace an ever-increasing volunteer workload. We need to actively discourage overcommitment‚Ä¶ and never ask for more than anyone should rationally be able to give.</p>
<p><strong>We need to be thoughtful to fellow volunteers.</strong> It‚Äôs easy to get frustrated when people drop the ball. We need to check in on each other, be supportive and remember that we are all doing this for free, in our spare time, because we support the same cause and the same mission. We need to be understanding, not judgmental. We need to offer support, not criticism.</p>
<p><strong>Understand the difference between governance and micromanagement.</strong> Yes, we need boards to make sure that the money is being handled properly and the mission is well-defined. But the board shouldn‚Äôt micromanage everything. We need to let people do the tasks we ask them to do.</p>
<p><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Life can change in the blink of an eye. Be flexible with expectations. Be understanding when things don‚Äôt turn out the way you wanted. And realize that every volunteer is balancing life and work and family.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, we need to remember to have fun.</strong> These organizations and boards that we support, love and commit our time to‚Ä¶ they should be enjoyable. And if they aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs time to fix them.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Electric truck and SUV manufacturer <a href="https://rivian.com">Rivian</a> announced their new R2 SUV today, but surprised everyone with <a href="https://rivian.com/msp">a smaller R3 version as well.</a> I love smaller cars and I&rsquo;ve been waiting for new smaller EVs to hit the market, hopefully at a lower price point. The R3 looks adorable and it reminds me of a VW Rabbit, which I used to drive.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But Rivian didn&rsquo;t publish any specs so it&rsquo;s hard to gauge how big R3 is.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they provided high res imagery and it&rsquo;s easy to see the tire details ‚Äî Pirelli Scorpion MS 235/55 R20. So based on a 20-inch rim size, and with a nice profile shot,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> it&rsquo;s possible to estimate the size with a little bit of simple math.</p>
<p>These numbers are rough, obviously. But here&rsquo;s what I got:</p>
<p><strong>Rivian 3</strong><br>
Length: 149 in.<br>
Height: 55 in.<br>
Wheelbase: 102 in.</p>
<p>That length looks a little short, but as you can tell from the picture, there is very little overhang in front or behind the wheels. For a point of reference, I compared those numbers with the specs of another EV model that I like a lot:</p>
<p><strong>2024 Hyundai IONIQ 5</strong><br>
Length: 182.5 in.<br>
Height: 63 in.<br>
Wheelbase: 118.1 in</p>
<p>The Rivian R3 looks to be a good bit smaller than the IONIQ 5 in all dimensions. In fact, the R3 looks closest to the size of a four-door gas-powered Mini Cooper:</p>
<p><strong>2024 Mini Cooper Four-Door</strong><br>
Length: 158.5 in.<br>
Height: 56.1 in.<br>
Wheelbase: 101.1 in</p>
<p>Of course, there are lots of caveats to this comparison. My numbers are rough, the car is a prototype, and things can change as the car moves to production. Who knows when it will be available to purchase, but I&rsquo;m excited about the Rivian R3. I&rsquo;m not in the market right now, but my next car purchase will be an EV. That size is actually perfect for what I want ‚Äì a small EV to commute back and forth to work. Now we&rsquo;ll see where the price falls.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

			 <p>I used to dread calling my grandmother on her birthday. My mom died on that day and so every time I‚Äôd call, she‚Äôd start with ‚ÄúWell, you know, I wish Nancy was still here.‚Äù And that always bothered me and usually made me tear up, so I would wait as long as I could to call. I was pretty sure that I was the last grandkid to call each year.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago today, I called GiGi<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to wish her happy 89th birthday. She answered the phone upbeat and excited, telling me about all the people who had called her earlier in the day (including my siblings and all of my cousins, letting me know that I was, in fact, the last grandchild to call.) But she closed with a surprising statement, subtly mentioning that she ‚Äúhelped someone old today.‚Äù I was intrigued and asked for details.</p>
<p>GiGi was at the gas station filling up when she noticed an ‚Äúold‚Äù man struggling to take the money up to the cashier. She took the money up for him and they struck up a conversation. The man was recovering from a double knee replacement. He was upset with his doctor that they&rsquo;d done both knees at the same time, and told him that ‚Äúnext time, we‚Äôre doing them one at a time.‚Äù The doctor told him ‚ÄúMr. Jones. You are 99 years old. We aren‚Äôt doing another knee replacement.‚Äù</p>
<p>I tell that story often, but realized I‚Äôve never written it down. I love how many lessons about attitudes, expectations and perspective are packed into one story. GiGi passed away a few years ago, living to the age of 98. Today would have been her 101st birthday. There are many stories to tell, but this is the story I tell about her most often and wanted to share it on her birthday.</p>

			 <p>March 3, many years ago, my mom died unexpectedly. In perhaps one of the greatest understatements ever, I struggled with her loss. Some days, I still struggle with her loss.</p>
<p>I discovered that on March 3, every year, I was grumpy. Kinda pissed off. And in general, not a fun person to be around. So I declared the day ‚ÄúInternational Bob is Grumpy Day.‚Äù Gave it a silly name. Explain to people how I&rsquo;m feeling. I told coworkers that it probably wasn‚Äôt the best day to ask me challenging questions. Or rely on me to be particularly tactful. In short, March 3 was the one day a year that it‚Äôs best to leave me alone. It worked. People left me alone, and I, predictably, was grumpy.</p>
<p>March 3 was also my grandmother&rsquo;s birthday. I&rsquo;d call her and she&rsquo;d mention how much she missed mom. And usually, I&rsquo;d tear up. Maybe the anticipation of the call was what made me grumpy. I don&rsquo;t know. Over time, I became less grumpy on March 3. Still sad, but I was able to understand the grief a little better. Decades heal. In my most recent job, my coworkers understood, but also didn‚Äôt let me sit in my office alone.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> They worked hard to keep my spirits up.</p>
<p>This year, I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs time to retire International Bob is Grumpy Day. Instead of sulking, we are taking a day trip with the whole family ‚Äî my oldest is home from college on Spring Break ‚Äî and I‚Äôm going to enjoy the company of the people that I love. And take pictures. Because honestly, that‚Äôs the way mom would have wanted it.</p>

And while I think it‚Äôs probably the right call to end the program, I do understand why Apple tried.</p>
<p>Ten years ago when Apple started the project, it was the perfect moment to rethink the automobile. With the change to battery powered electric powertrains, many of the traditional constraints of car design were no longer relevant. You no longer need a motor, or a gas tank. Cars are more reliant on their technology stack. There were very few competitors and they were almost all selling cars at the high end of the market. It seemed like a perfect time for Apple to step into revolutionizing the design of cars, questioning the established conventions of the past. Changing how cars were designed, manufactured and sold.</p>
<p>And yet, today, that‚Äôs not what happened. In general, electric cars today look like gas-powered cars, but without the tailpipes. There are reasons for this, I think ‚Äî consumer buying habits, aerodynamics and federal safety laws ‚Äî but the result is that this isn‚Äôt the revolution that it looked like it might be. Couple that with the fact that the no-steering-wheel, self-driving tech that Apple was rumored to be pursuing is decades away from being truly reliable.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Battery advances are slow. When they started, there were few competitors, but that‚Äôs changed and lots of established car makers are committing to electric cars, with the addition of new upstarts like China‚Äôs BYD.</p>
<p>I understand why Apple started their car program. But after a decade of being stuck in neutral, I also understand why they finally ended it.</p>

A new church down the road installs a large sign. Not wanting to fall behind the times, the established church installs a new sign, too. This sign allows the church to add custom messages to the sign by manually arranging letters.</p>
<p>At first, the church simply puts up their service times, but some people think that‚Äôs boring. The church needs more catchy information on their sign. Something that people driving by will engage with. The pastor recommends putting the sermon title on the sign, but after a few weeks, realizes that she‚Äôs got to come up with a catchy sermon title <em>every</em> single week. Someone volunteers to update it with a new bible verse each week, but they get tired of updating it and eventually stop. Another person finds a list of attention-grabbing church sign messages on the internet and volunteers to put those on the sign. But theologically, some of the quotes don&rsquo;t align with the church&rsquo;s teachings and others of them aren‚Äôt exactly welcoming. Some people driving by are offended by some of the messages. After a couple of years, everyone is sick of dealing with the sign, but the sign is very visible on the main road into town. The sign must be updated.</p>
<p>A handful of members decide to get together. They don‚Äôt exactly call themselves the ‚Äúsign committee,‚Äù but they meet every so often to talk about the sign and what to put on it. After months of discussing the sign, they realize that the real problem is that they have to manually update the sign each week. Going out to the sign with those letters on cards takes time and a better solution would be to have a digital sign that could be updated remotely through the internet. As a bonus, one of these signs can cycle through multiple messages.</p>
<p>They raise the money and update their sign to have a beautiful glowing digital display. The sign is bright, but some people think it‚Äôs too bright. They start by including the service times each week. And bible verses. And sermon titles. And upcoming events. At first, lots of people are excited about the new sign and have lots of ideas, but over time, that excitement fades. Some people think the sign changes messages too quickly. While the sign is easier to update, keeping track of multiple messages, chasing down information, and updating the graphics takes more time than the old sign did. The sign becomes more than a weekly task. It‚Äôs a job. Sometimes, the sign glitches and a technician has to come fix it. Everyone is frustrated with the sign, but the money was spent and the sign is there. It needs to be updated.</p>
<p>Finally, the pastor decides that they are spending too much time dealing with the sign. She switches the sign to share a single message: ‚ÄúAll are welcome.‚Äù Some people complain that the church isn‚Äôt using the sign to its fullest potential. But secretly, everyone is glad they don‚Äôt have to deal with it anymore.</p>
<hr>
<p>I‚Äôve used a shorter version of this metaphor to talk about social media feeds that suck time and energy from an organization that doesn‚Äôt really need one (and usually doesn‚Äôt have the resources to support one). But I‚Äôve been thinking that this parable/extended metaphor actually has a broader application. A couple of reflection questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many times do we take something on because we want what someone else has?</li>
<li>How often do we chase a new solution because it‚Äôs shiny and bright?</li>
<li>How often do you let the opinions of ‚Äúsome people‚Äù change how you feel about decisions?</li>
<li>What decision could you make that would simplify your life?</li>
<li>What have you built that you no longer need, but that you continue to spend significant time on?</li>
<li>When have you made a decision that turned out to be much more work than you planned? How did you handle it?</li>
<li>Has someone made a decision your secretly agree with? Why haven‚Äôt you told them?</li>
</ul>

			 <h2 id="a-new-look-and-branding-for-honda-evs">A new look and branding for Honda EVs</h2>
<p>Honda showed off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24030236/honda-zero-ev-global-series-concept-ces">two new EV concepts</a> under the new Honda Zero brand at CES ‚Äî the Saloon and the Space-Hub. Most of the coverage is focused on the futuristic looks of the concept cars. As someone who grew up going to the Chicago Auto Show and seeing the cars of the future, I‚Äôd temper any expectations that the final designs will be this radical.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But as a branding researcher, what caught my attention is that they also rolled out <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a46339613/honda-new-logo-evs/">a new Honda ‚Äúflying H‚Äù logo</a> to be used on all new electric cars. From the <a href="https://hondanews.com/en-US/electrification/releases/honda-debuts-new-global-honda-0-ev-series-with-two-new-concept-models">official Honda press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The current Honda ‚ÄúH mark‚Äù has a long history, dating back to 1981. In launching the next-generation EVs, Honda designed a new H mark, to express the company‚Äôs determination to undergo a historic transformation as well as the ability to constantly pursue new challenges and advancements. This new design expression, which symbolizes two outstretched hands, represents Honda‚Äôs commitment to expand the possibilities of mobility and continue to meet the needs of its customers. The new H mark will be applied on future Honda EV models, including the Honda 0 Series.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The logo simplifies Honda&rsquo;s current H, removing the outer bounding box and reshaping the mark. It does feel like a more modern mark and seems appropriate on the futuristic vehicles. As logo introductions go, this might be the slowest roll out in the history of visual branding since the first Honda Zero cars won‚Äôt be released until 2026. And since the logo is intended for <em>just</em> electric vehicles, that means that Honda is choosing to fragment their brand for a period of time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Honda Zero brand had its own mark at introduction. I&rsquo;d be surprised if this is used in marketing when the models debut in 2026. I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s going on here, since the elements don&rsquo;t really match anything.</p>
<p>Electric car branding is fascinating to me. VW and BMW add a letter or letters to the model number. Hyundai is using the Ioniq brand name for most, but not all of their EVs. Many vendors are rolling out EVs alongside their internal combustion engine lineup. VW is resurrecting the old Scout brand for a line of electric SUVs.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But to my knowledge, Honda is the first company to create a version of their corporate logo especially for electric vehicles. As the transition to electric vehicles continues, it will be interesting to see how EV branding continues to shift and evolve.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I adopt a theme each year and last year, the theme was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reset<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That theme included focusing on physical and mental health, writing more, getting organized and rediscovering creative endeavors. I made progress with three out of four goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote more, getting my first journal article published and I have several others in the works. I‚Äôve written more here on Micro.Blog in 2023. So mission accomplished.</li>
<li>I did a good job getting organized, but I need to stay organized. There are still some areas I need to work on, but I feel like I made some progress.</li>
<li>I worked on a bunch of my typeface designs and even though I‚Äôm not ready to release anything, I feel like I was able to dedicate some time to visual projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>That leaves physical and mental health. I was particularly physically active for the first few months of the year, but hit a rough spot around April and lost momentum. I never got back in a rhythm.</p>
<h3 id="this-year-more-of-the-same">This year, more of the same</h3>
<p>As I started to plan for 2024, I felt like my focus was going to be solely on health. I felt great at the beginning of 2023 when I was more physically active, and I definitely want to get back to that level of activity. Combine that with processing the unexpected death of a coworker a few days ago ‚Äî who was younger than I am ‚Äî and I‚Äôm solidly committed to getting healthier in 2024.</p>
<p>But as I read over the list of my goals from last year, I still see room to improve in those areas, too. I‚Äôm still working on my Ph.D. and carving out time to write is critical. I still need to work on personal organization. And I need to work on creative projects ‚Äî especially getting into a routine with my sketchbook.</p>
<p>So I go into 2024 with four goals&hellip; basically the same goals that I had last year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Get healthy.</strong> I‚Äôm not trying to run any races or achieve some incredible physical feat, but I do need to eat healthier and make time for physical activity. This is, without a doubt, my number one priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write more.</strong> Continue to write here, and work toward my Ph.D.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get organized and stay organized.</strong> Continue to refine and evolve my methods and tools for staying organized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explore creative endeavors.</strong> Keep working on typefaces, but also, get back into the habit of sketching regularly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôve got a lot to be excited about in 2024, including my 25th wedding anniversary in August. I‚Äôm looking forward to a healthy and productive year.</p>

<ol>
<li>Our oldest decided to attend the University of South Carolina and had a great first semester.</li>
<li>Liz and I are notably bad a selfies, but this outtake was better than the actual selfie and I love it.</li>
<li>The girls were a little excited about seeing Taylor Swift in concert. (It was an amazing concert and I‚Äôm glad we all got to go.)</li>
<li>We have a high school graduate.</li>
<li>This is a big kitty yawn, but it looks so fierce.</li>
<li>Ryan is still playing lacrosse and bounced back after some adversity this summer to have a great rec season.</li>
<li>We attended my nephew&rsquo;s football playoff games. This was the final play in overtime that sent them to the state championship. They won that game, and won a state championship.</li>
<li>Birthday hike for my oldest included a stop at Looking Glass Falls in Pisgah National Forest. It was so cold, that the rocks were covered with ice.</li>

I have mostly independent studies, online classes and my dissertation to go. I&rsquo;m a part-time student, so I still have a couple of years left, but it seems like some sort of a milestone.</p>

<p>In an ironic twist, other workers are now also finding themselves nostalgic for the age of the cubicle.</p>

<p>Not sure about that. As someone who recently moved from a cubicle to an actual office with walls, a door and windows, I can honestly say that I don&rsquo;t miss my old desk. That said, the article is an interesting read on the changing nature of the office after the pandemic.</p>

<p>Ryan&rsquo;s last two lacrosse games for this season were earlier today. He&rsquo;s been a goalie for a year-and-a-half now and he&rsquo;s gotten pretty good, expecially since he&rsquo;s just 11. It takes a special mentality to stand in there, shot after shot. If you notice in the image above, the ball is in the right side of the image flying toward him. Don&rsquo;t worry, he saved that one.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure he was going to play this season. He had a rough experience this summer, playing up two age levels against elite travel competition and it was a disaster. His confidence was obliterated and his body took a beating. His coaches admitted they were worried he was done after the experience. He put his stick in the corner when we got home from the last tournament and it stayed there, untouched, until about a week before the fall rec season. With the sign up deadline approaching, we talked and he decided to try again and see if he could get back in the groove. He really does enjoy playing and especially being part of a team. The result: He went 9-1 on the season and continued to get better and learn his position.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long he&rsquo;ll keep playing. He&rsquo;s looking forward to trying out for the JV team in a little over a year, so that&rsquo;s his next goal. But however long he decides to stick with it, I&rsquo;m immensely proud of his determination and resilience.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://bobwertz.com/2023/10/06/published-new-first.html">Milestone: My first published research paper is now online</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I‚Äôve reached a big milestone in my academic career: my first published research paper.</p>
<p><em>Brand new: How visual context shapes initial response to logos and corporate visual identity systems</em> has bene published in the Journal of Product and Brand Management. It‚Äôs available now online and will  eventually be assigned to an issue. If you have access to journal articles through a university or public library, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPBM-08-2022-4124/full/html">you can access the article.</a></p>
<p>If you can‚Äôt access the article, here‚Äôs the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a new logo is released, it does not have an established meaning in the mind of the viewer. As logos have become more highly scrutinized by consumers and critics, it has become more important to understand viewers‚Äô initial response to logos. While other studies have researched the impact of aesthetic choices on viewer reaction to logos, this study aims to understand the effect of the surrounding visual identity system when a new logo is introduced. This study combines a content analysis of 335 posts on the logo review website <em>Brand New</em> with the voting data from their polls to understand how visual context correlates with a viewer‚Äôs initial response. Increased amounts of visual context correlate to an improved response from viewers. Different types of context that can be presented ‚Äì from logo variations and environmental examples to videos and animation ‚Äì have varied effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, my study finds that people respond better to new logos when they are shown more examples of the logo in use. This is one of those things that seems intuitive to designers, but hasn‚Äôt been researched or quantified. Because I‚Äôm a designer, most people are surprised that my research includes a fair amount of statistical analysis, but I‚Äôve really taken to the quantitive side of things. This paper has been in review for over a year, working it‚Äôs way through the revision process.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs fitting that this is my first paper to be published. When I started grad school, I didn‚Äôt really know anything about scholarly research. In the spring of 2019 ‚Äî my second semester as a grad student ‚Äî I took a content analysis class with Carol Pardun. I was the only master‚Äôs level student in a class full of Ph.D. students. I felt so overwhelmed by the pressure to come up with an idea and learn methods and theories on the fly. The paper I wrote for that class was the first version of this paper. It was accepted to the AEJMC Conference that August and I presented in Toronto ‚Äî my first academic conference presentation. I loved the concept for the study and got great feedback, but I was still learning and felt like I could improve it. I scrapped everything, started over with a larger sample and better methodology. After Dr. Pardun retired, I started working with Tara Mortensen on the next evolution of this work, which turned into my thesis. And that thesis eventually became this paper.</p>
<p>Thanks go out to so many people who‚Äôve help me along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Pardun for supporting my bizarre little project, especially in the early days when the project was taking shape.</li>
<li>All of the Ph.D. students in that content analysis class who helped me figure things out and took me under their wing.</li>
<li>Dr. Mortensen for taking over as my thesis director and helping guide me through the publication process.</li>
<li>Kevin Hull and Van Kornegay for serving on my committee and providing helpful feedback.</li>
<li>Robert McKeever and Jacob Long for giving me an appropriate foundation for analyzing data.</li>
<li>Editor Cleopatra Veloutsou who guided me through the process with the <em>Journal of Product and Brand Management</em>.</li>
<li>All of the reviewers and discussants at the conference level for AEJMC and in the peer review process whose feedback legitimately made this paper better.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, this couldn‚Äôt have happened without the rest of Team Wertz. Liz and the kids have been so supportive and patient while I have embarked on this grad school journey. (And occasionally, Norah and Jill even joined me at Starbucks when I had to write.) I simply could not have done it without them.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve still got a few years left until I finish my classwork and dissertation, but I‚Äôm exceptionally proud of this milestone and excited to see where my research goes next.</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow night, the Ahsoka finale airs on Disney+. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the show. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but I love Star Wars Rebels and it&rsquo;s great to see a continuation of the story line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a few absurd ideas about the finale that I figured I&rsquo;d share. Our heroes are on Peridea, in another galaxy. Thrawn is ready to come back to the core galaxy, partnered with the Nightsisters, to restore the Empire.</p>
<p>Here are 9 absurd things that <em>are not</em> going to happen on the season finale of Ahsoka:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Our heroes (and maybe villains) will remain stuck in the Peridea galaxy. That would at least explain where they were during the Rise of Skywalker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Force ghost Kanan Jarrus appears to&hellip; Ezra? Hera? Jacen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yoda&rsquo;s species is actually from this new galaxy, and they are the enemies of the Nightsisters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an even darker power in the new galaxy that is stronger than the Nightsisters and Thrawn&hellip; which is why they want to escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huyang helps Ezra make a new lightsaber, and the blade is&hellip; yellow or purple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All those New Republic ships are actually filled with Imperial technology and spies and Thrawn will be able to control them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Jedi temple on Peridea&hellip; with a portal that transports our heroes to Lothal via wolf ride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post credit scene features Hera assembling a team to fight Thrawn&hellip; including Zeb, the Mandalorian, Grogu, the surviving members of the Bad Batch and Rex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baylan Skoll actually does have a plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I warned you they were absurd, but the list was fun to come up with. Looking forward to seeing where the show lands. There is no way they can resolve all the various plot threads, so I assume there will be another season, or the storyline will be continued in another series. Eventually, we already know this leads to a new Dave Filoni-directed movie.</p>

			 <p>Today is a holiday, but my daughter needed to study and I had some grad school work to do so we headed out to Starbucks. This was the only coffee shop near my house when I started grad school and I was here for long hours most weekends. It was open late and was seemingly always filled with other grad students. After COVID shut everything down, several new coffee shops opened up including two very close to my house. I don&rsquo;t visit &ldquo;Grad School Starbucks&rdquo; very often these days, but it&rsquo;s funny how a space can hold so many memories&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently, we started rewatching Alias, the 2000s ABC spy thriller by J.J. Abrams.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> All five seasons are on Disney+ and we started from the beginning. Season 1 has 22 episodes, which was once considered a &ldquo;full season.&rdquo; Now, a streaming show rarely has more than 8 or 10 episodes a season.</p>
<p>Alias became a hit and attracted new viewers over the first season. But in the broadcast TV era, there wasn&rsquo;t an easy way for people to go back and watch the episodes they&rsquo;d missed. I remember ABC trying to rerun episodes as it gained popularity. And the &ldquo;previously on&rdquo; section got hilariously longer to try and catch people up.</p>
<p>The 17th episode of season 1, &ldquo;Q&amp;A,&rdquo; is an exposition-filled clip show where a skeptical FBI agent quizzes super spy Sydney Bristow (played by Jennifer Garner). She answers his questions, explaining the premise of the series while showing clips from previous episodes. Sydney basically tells the viewer everything they need to know in the lead up to the season finale. There&rsquo;s a reveal at the end of the episode&hellip; a revelation to keep the newly updated viewer hooked to come back next week.</p>
<p>As I watched it, I realized that this type of clip show episode ‚Äî once a staple of 20+ episode network TV seasons ‚Äî will likely fade from existence. Streaming services like Disney+ allow people to go back and watch the whole season easily. And shorter seasons mean that you don&rsquo;t need a budget-friendly recap episode. In today&rsquo;s streaming world, there is simply no longer a reason to make a clip show.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>We are in the midst of a huge shift in television. Most of the attention is directed at the financial aspects of the streaming era. The demise of the clip show episode is a comparatively minor shift, but it demonstrates how the changing financial model of the television industry directly shapes the creative product itself.</p>

			 <p>When the exodus from Twitter first started last year, many tech-savvy people were moving to Mastodon and <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/12/01/brands-federated.html">I wondered if brands would move their accounts to self hosted instances.</a> After all, from a branding standpoint, @offical@starbucks.com is better than @starbucks@mastodon.social. At the end of that post, I posited that someone would come along with a service that handled the fediverse complexity for companies.</p>
<p>That service is Threads.</p>
<p>Lots of people have asked why Meta was interested in providing ActivityPub support. I honestly think part of the story is so Meta can tell brands &ndash; their advertisers &ndash; that they can just publish on Threads and it will eventually be accessible on any other non-Twitter platform. Of course, they&rsquo;ve still got to deliver on that promise&hellip; right now Threads doesn&rsquo;t have ActivityPub support.</p>
<p>So far, branded accounts have flocked to Threads. If @BRAND-NAME@threads.com becomes the default for official branded social content, Meta benefits. I still think companies would be better off owning their instance with a branded domain, and maybe we will get there some day, but for now, it looks like Threads is where the brands are headed.</p>
<p>(I think that eventually, Meta will offer an upgraded &ldquo;brand tier&rdquo; that allows companies to use their own domain instead of <a href="http://threads.com">@threads.com</a>. for a substanial fee, of course.)</p>

			 <h3 id="ive-been-preparing-for-twitters-demise-for-seven-years-but-i-didnt-see-x-coming">I‚Äôve been preparing for Twitter‚Äôs demise for seven years, but I didn‚Äôt see ‚ÄòX‚Äô coming.</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I‚Äôve been preparing for the end of Twitter since 2016, when Twitter was struggling with some financial issues and the future was uncertain. I pondered what would happen of Twitter went away suddenly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2016/11/9/twitterless?rq=twitterless">2016: Twitterless:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which got me thinking, what if we woke up one morning and Twitter was gone. Or more likely, what if Twitter changed so radically, that it was unusable?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm more concerned that Twitter, or a company that buys Twitter, will change it so completely, that it becomes useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward a little over a year later. Twitter‚Äôs financial issues were less dire, but they were struggling with flat user growth, coupled with a rise in abuse and hate on the platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/3/twitterless-part-ii?rq=twitterless">2018: Twitterless, Part II:</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Twitter tries to jumpstart the service, I still believe the likelihood of Twitter imploding within the next few years is high.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Elon Musk bought Twitter, I assumed he‚Äôd shake things up, but I was concerned about the direction he would take Twitter in. I wrote a third Twitterless post to recap the changes that I‚Äôd made to deal with the hypothetical demise of Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/07/twitterless-part-iii.html">2022: Twitterless, Part III:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Twitter ceases to be enjoyable, I‚Äôll leave. To be honest, I‚Äôll miss it. I joined in 2008 and 14 years is a long time to use any service. It‚Äôs part of my daily routine. At the end of the day, though, if a service isn‚Äôt making my life better, I‚Äôm better off without it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once Twitter abruptly cut off third party clients, my Twitter usage dropped dramatically. I was a Twitteriffic user for over a decade, and it was obvious from the way he handled that situation that Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter wasn‚Äôt going to be what I wanted. I moved on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, he‚Äôs changing the name of Twitter to X. I always assumed that someone would buy Twitter for the brand equity and change the service to make it more profitable. Instead, Musk changed the service <em>and</em> destroyed an iconic brand, all while making it <em>less</em> profitable.</p>
<p>I am going to miss Twitter. I‚Äôve mostly enjoyed it over the years. I care enough about my own tweet history, that earlier this year, <a href="https://www.manton.org/2023/04/11/importing-tweets-to.html">when Manton offered a way to import all of my Twitter history,</a> I moved 15 years worth of tweets into <a href="https://bobwertz.com/tweets/">a searchable database hosted here on Micro.Blog.</a> I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll use it for, but I do like having it.</p>
<p>I feel like I‚Äôve prepared adequately for the Twitter apocalypse, but there is one area in particular where the loss of Twitter will still hurt. A common thread through all three Twitterless posts was a lament that there aren‚Äôt other services optimized for following breaking news or live events. This is still true. Maybe Threads,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Bluesky or Mastodon can step in, but until then, I‚Äôll miss Twitter most when watching a sporting event, an Apple keynote or following a local news story. For the last few months, I‚Äôve been viewing Twitter to check in during big events, but the time has come to move on.</p>
<p>Twitter is finally dead.</p>

			 <h3 id="new-social-media-outlets-prove-the-viability-of-indie-social">New social media outlets prove the viability of indie social.</h3>
<p>The invention of the printing press made mass media possible. Printing houses produced popular books and bibles, but they also spread the writing that powered the Reformation. Major newspapers became was the dominant media for decades, but there have always been community and independent newspapers. Self-publishing, indie music, art house films and college radio are all forms of independent media.</p>
<p>Economy of scale<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> pushes these systems toward consolidation. But as these media outlets consolidate into a few major players, there is always a market for an alternative. Why should social media be any different?</p>
<p>When the internet became popular, personal sites and blogs were the ultimate form of independent media. Economy of scale kicked in like it always does. Large news sites dominate and Google Search drives the traffic to the largest most well established sites.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Blogs became less popular, but there are still many independent blogs and personal sites around the internet.</p>
<p>With social media, consolidation drove us to a handful of sites. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok and Snapchat. The funding model drove this as well‚Ä¶ Venture capital investment bet on the next big social media winner, and sites either made it big, or disappeared. (RIP: Path, Vine, Periscope, Gowalla, Google+, Google Wave.) I wasn‚Äôt sure there was space for independent social media.</p>
<p>All of the attention right now is on Meta‚Äôs Threads and the cage match with Twitter, but there‚Äôs a lot more going on in the space. Elon‚Äôs purchase and erosion of Twitter<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> has opened the doors to alternatives. ActivityPub is starting to take root that will allow some interoperability between sites. I‚Äôve been a Micro.Blog subscriber for years and it‚Äôs a wonderful independent social space.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Mastodon and Bluesky are both putting forward their visions for an open web. And users are adapting Discord and other sites to create smaller, independent communities.</p>
<p>These sites now have a large enough user base to stick around, and technical solutions like ActivityPub allow easy access to creators on other networks. The businesses aren‚Äôt (currently) poisoned by the venture capital desire to grow fast and get rich. This is how a healthy independent social media ecosystem develops.</p>

			 <p>Went down a rabbit hole and discovered that <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a42532492/iron-air-battery-energy-storage/">iron-air batteries are a thing&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each iron-air battery is about the size of a washer/dryer set and holds 50 iron-air cells, which are then surrounded by an electrolyte (similar to the Duracell in your TV remote). Using a principle called ‚Äúreverse rusting,‚Äù the cells ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù in air, which transforms the iron into iron oxide (aka rust) and produces energy. To charge it back up, a current reverses the oxidation and turns the cells back into iron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Reverse rusting?&rdquo; Weird. Interesting implications for power grid management, though.</p>

My local newspaper, The State, in included in News+ and I can read articles that are normally behind a paywall. Once I&rsquo;m there, I tend to find other things to read and share. But sharing Apple News story links on social media isn&rsquo;t always helpful since it obscures the real URL behind a redirect.</p>
<p>On a Mac, it‚Äôs easy to share the original URL. Click the share button in the upper right hand corner of the interface, and choose Safari. It opens the original article on the web and you can then share that URL instead of a link to Apple News.</p>
<p>On the iPhone, it‚Äôs not as simple. Click the ellipses in the upper right and select Share Story. Then from the list of apps that appears, select Safari. (You may need to click More and scroll down to find it.) The result is the same as the Mac, a new Safari window with the original URL.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2023/07/03/three-questions-ahead.html">I mentioned I was interested in the media narrative</a> surrounding the introduction of Instagram Threads. I wanted to expand on what I‚Äôm looking for, and to do that, I need to start with some mass communications theory.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a Ph.D. student that mostly researches visual effects, but I‚Äôve taken a few classes that look at how media effects work. There are levels to media effects, but essentially, you can break it into three types of effects.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Setting</strong> tells you what to think about.</li>
<li><strong>Framing</strong> tells you how to think about it.</li>
<li><strong>Priming</strong> prompts you to take an action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone teaches this a little differently, but this is how I like to think about it. As I look at how the media covers Instagram‚Äôs Thread, I think it‚Äôs worth thinking about the coverage in these terms.</p>
<h3 id="agenda-setting">Agenda Setting</h3>
<p>The media is very good and setting the ‚Äúagenda‚Äù for what people are thinking about. If the media you watch or read is covering a topic, you are more likely to care about the topic.</p>
<p>We know that the tech media like The Verge have picked up the thread and predictably, tech circles online are discussing what Instagram Threads will mean for social media and the Fediverse. This is agenda setting in action.</p>
<p>But will the <em>mass</em> media cover it? Will the CNN website run a story about Instagram Threads? Will The NY Times run an explainer about how to use Threads? Will South-Carolina-native and all-around good guy Craig Melvin talk about Threads on the Today Show? I don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>While ‚Äúagenda setting‚Äù sounds a little nefarious, it isn‚Äôt always. There are many factors that go into story selection. One major challenge right now is the crowded media environment. Take a look at the front pages of major news websites and what do you see? Supreme Court rulings. Mass shootings. Russia‚Äôs mutiny. Ukraine‚Äôs counteroffensive. Trump‚Äôs indictments. Protests in France. The U.S. relationship with China. Interest rates. Inflation. These topics all compete for space and time in a news organization. Does the introduction of a new service from Meta really rank up there in importance with these other topics?</p>
<p>News media also pay attention to metrics about their readership. If viewers are reading stories about Threads, editors will assign more stories. If people aren‚Äôt interested in the topic, it will fade. There seems to be general interest in the Elon Musk‚Äôs mismanagement of Twitter and his rivalry with Mark Zuckerberg. If people are reading the stories about Threads, maybe Meta does get a little more coverage than something like this would normally merit.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Honestly, I‚Äôll know if there is mass media coverage when my wife asks me what I think about it.</p>
<h3 id="framing">Framing</h3>
<p>The next level relates to how the stories are positioned. We know that tech media is framing the release of Instagram Threads as the latest change in a rapidly changing social media world. The stories right now seem to be largely framed as a contrast with existing Twitter alternatives, especially given the conversations within Mastodon admins about whether to preemptively block access to a service that may support ActivityPub.</p>
<p>But for a mass media audience, that‚Äôs all too nuanced. Given the high profile implosion of Twitter, and the bravado between Musk and Zuckerberg, I think pretty much every story is going to frame Instagram Threads as a Twitter-killer.
I do imagine that they‚Äôll at least mention Mastodon and Bluesky. Beyond that, who knows.</p>
<h3 id="priming">Priming</h3>
<p>If the mass media covers the introduction of Threads ‚Äì and the framing is positive ‚Äì the coverage may be enough to prompt people to sign up for accounts. This priming effect is typically short-lived, but if Meta is able to get a lot of news coverage, there may be a surge in sign ups not too dissimilar to the surge in interest surrounding Mastodon and Bluesky. This won‚Äôt necessarily translate into engaged customers, but getting people to download the app and try the service is the first hurdle for Meta.</p>
<hr>
<p>So as you look at the media coverage surrounding the launch of Instagram Threads, think about it in terms of agenda setting, framing and priming. (And actually, as you look at media bias in general, these three concepts are helpful in understanding how it works and why it happens.)</p>

<blockquote>

			 <p>I looks like Meta will release their text-based, Instagram-branded Twitter competitor this week.

Not really. I&rsquo;m happy with the current state of my social media usage.</p>
<p>Am I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->curious<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about it? Absolutely. We are in a fascinating period of change in the services we use online and the ways we share information. Specifically, I&rsquo;m interested in three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Will Instagram users actually adopt it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This is the big question. Will the people I follow on Instagram start accounts? And will they post content that I&rsquo;m interested in? What will the demographics of the user base be? So many question about what this audience might look like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How will the ActivityPub implementation work?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> As a devoted Micro.Blog user, I&rsquo;m interested in the rumored ActivityPub integration. Will I be able to follow Threads users on Micro.Blog? Can I cross post from Micro.Blog? As the first mainstream ActivityPub implementation, it will be interesting to see how they connect with the larger Fediverse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What&rsquo;s the media narrative?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It&rsquo;s guaranteed that there will be a direct contrast with the dumpster fire that Twitter has become, but what other media narratives will take shape. How will it be compared to Mastodon and Bluesky? Will media coverage increase consumer knowledge about the ActivityPub? Sounds like a research paper for grad school.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably sign up for an account, since Instagram is pretty much the only social media I use other than Micro.Blog. And we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

			 <p>While on a roadtrip to Asheville, NC this weekend, I was looking for what electric cars I&rsquo;d see along the way. This weekend, in addition to a bunch of Teslas, I spotted two Rivian SUVs, a Kia EV6, a few Chevy Bolts and a Polestar 2. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen a Rivian R1S in person. Looked sharp.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been to a lot of high school graduations over the years. And most of them aren&rsquo;t great. They start late. The guest speakers and district officials give speeches that aren&rsquo;t particularly inspirational. The student speakers share a bunch of inside jokes that make sense to a small slice of the graduating class. And they just last too long.</p>
<p>So while I was looking forward to my daughter&rsquo;s graduation today, I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to the ceremony itself. (Not to mention the ceremony was held at 8 a.m. on a Wednesday morning.)</p>
<p>What I got instead was a delightful ceremony. It started right at 8:00. The student speakers did a wonderful job. They incorporated some meaningful traditions. The district superintendent delivered short and relevant remarks. The whole thing was done in 1.5 hours with around 350 students graduating. Everyone had their name read and crossed the stage. My daughter was happy and I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

			 <p>Our neighbors installed a new security system a couple of weeks ago. When you walk anywhere near it &ndash; and that radius includes <em>our</em> driveway &ndash; a recording plays: &ldquo;You are currently being recorded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have great neighbors, but when I first heard it, I was a little annoyed. My wife was irritated, too. Every time we walked to our cars&hellip; &ldquo;You are currently being recorded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days after this started, I was walking out to the car with my kids and the alarm system informed us that we were being recorded&hellip; and my 15-year-old daughter waived in the general direction of the camera, yelled &ldquo;Hello camera&rdquo; and got in the car. She repeats this greeting every day when she leaves for school, choosing to be amused instead of irritated.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There are two lessons in this story:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t install a talking alarm system. It&rsquo;s annoying. (My neighbor isn&rsquo;t happy either. He says it is way too sensitive and goes off at the slightest movement.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can choose to be amused instead of irritated. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s best to greet the metaphorical camera and go on with your day.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure when the ‚Äúhot take‚Äù era started. It predates the internet<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but social media really seems to have kicked it into the stratosphere. There‚Äôs a rush to hype everything as the next disruptive invention. Wearable devices. Foldable displays. Ride sharing and self-driving cars. Blockchain and cryptocurrency. Artificial intelligence and machine learning. AR and VR. Federated social media.</p>
<p>While social media drives the hype train, it‚Äôs powered by money. Major companies are afraid of missing a big trend and becoming irrelevant. Small companies see an opportunity to move fast and take advantage of the new tech. VC firms are willing to gamble on the technology in hopes of a big pay day. Entrepreneurs sell grand visions with hopes of making it big. All of these entities benefit from building the hype around every new technology.</p>
<p>What technology really needs is time to mature. Time to work the bugs out. To discover the downsides and figure out how to address them. To build a sustainable business model. Instead, too often, the money-powered hype train moves too fast and the whole thing just derails.</p>
<p>I love reading about technology and learning about all the latest advancements, but I‚Äôve been following technology long enough to know that slow and steady usually wins the race.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <p>Working on editing a journal article that I got a revise and resubmit on. This is my first time through the academic publishing process, and I have to admit that it&rsquo;s a challenging process. I&rsquo;ve lived with this research for years and I&rsquo;ve rewritten some version of this paper so many times&hellip; It started life as a class assignment, then a conference presentation. I completely started from scratch and redid the study to be a MA thesis project. And now, I&rsquo;m submitting it as a journal article. I love the study and I know I&rsquo;ll get it published eventually, but the process is long, y&rsquo;all.</p>

			 <h2 id="whats-in-hanger-bay-12">What‚Äôs in Hanger Bay 12?</h2>
<p><strong>WARNING: Spoilers and speculation about Star Trek: Picard.</strong></p>
<p>In Star Trek Picard season 3, episode 6, <em>The Bounty</em>, the USS Titan jumps to the Starfleet Ship Museum to get help from Commodore Geordi La Forge. The first exterior shot of the museum includes a selection of familiar ships (like the Enterprise A, Voyager and the Defiant) positioned in rings around the exterior of the space dock. There was one empty ring, and so the Titan &ldquo;hides&rdquo; in plain sight among the museum ships.</p>
<p>When Geordi and his daughter Alandra beam aboard the Titan, they reveal that the Titan and all modern Federation ships are networked with each other. Starfleet will find them. Picard is pleading with Geordi to help when his daughter interrupts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alandra (quietly): ‚ÄúDad. What about Hanger Bay 12?‚Äù<br>
Geordi (exasperated): ‚ÄúAlandra. Please.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the dialog continues. I assumed that what was in Hanger Bay 12 would be the key to the episode, but it‚Äôs not. Jack Crusher steals the cloaking device from Star Trek IV&rsquo;s Klingon Bird of Prey and the Titan rushes off to rescue Raffi, Riker and Worf on Daystrom Station. Hanger Bay 12 is never mentioned again.</p>
<p>So, what‚Äôs in Hanger Bay 12? Likely a new ship for the museum that was intended for that empty circle that the Titan parked in. Alandra clearly thinks the ship would be helpful ‚Äî maybe because it‚Äôs not networked. I assume that the ship in Hanger Bay 12 was likely intended to be unveiled as part of the Frontier Day ceremony and then intended to fill the empty ring at the Fleet Museum. Instead, I imagine that Picard and crew are going to come riding to the rescue in that ship&hellip;</p>
<p>My guess: The Enterprise 1701-D.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt think of any other ships that are significant enough and aren‚Äôt already represented in fleet museum. The 1701-D was destroyed in <em>Star Trek: Generations</em>, though. How could it reappear? Well, at least one of the ships they show in the museum, The Enterprise 1801-A, is a replica since the original was destroyed in <em>Star Trek III</em>. The new Enterprise-D could simply be a retrofitted Galaxy-class starship. Or the original 1701-D saucer section paired with a different Galaxy-class body.</p>
<p>It might seem like excessive fan-service, but if done well, I think it would be incredible to see the crew save the day in the ship from the TV show. Picard, Riker and Troi in the three command seats. Worf at tactical. Data at helm. Geordi in engineering. It would be a fun conclusion to this final season of Star Trek Picard.</p>

			 <h2 id="the-beta-service-gives-some-insight-into-how-adobe-views-ais-role-in-the-creative-process">The beta service gives some insight into how Adobe views AI&rsquo;s role in the creative process.</h2>
<p>I recently got access to <a href="https://firefly.adobe.com">Adobe Firefly</a>, a beta generative AI system. It‚Äôs not a surprise at all that Adobe is experimenting with generative creative tools. Adobe is clearly looking at ways AI can integrate with the tools that they already offer. Thankfully, unlike an earlier wave of visual AI tools, Adobe has trained their AI model on properly-licensed images. Generated images are restricted to non-commercial use and a label is added to exported images, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23587393/ai-art-copyright-lawsuit-getty-images-stable-diffusion">you shouldn‚Äôt see a Getty Images watermark anywhere.</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been following news about generative AI, but I haven‚Äôt really experimented with any of the other tools. It‚Äôs been more of an abstract curiosity. Now after playing with Adobe Firefly, I can see some of the practical implications of generative AI tools and started to think about how those features could fit into a design workflow. Also, as a Ph.D. student trying to settle on a dissertation topic, I see lots of research questions when I look at generative AI and Adobe Firefly.</p>
<p>Right now, the service has two features: Text to Image and Text Effects. I‚Äôve spent a little bit of time experimenting with Adobe Firefly and wanted to share some initial impressions.</p>
<h3 id="text-to-image">Text to image</h3>
<p>The text to image feature is straightforward. Type in a prompt and Firefly generates four images. On the right, there is a palette with options that lets you refine your request. You can choose the aspect ratio, content type, style, lighting and composition. Below is a screenshot of the interface and a few examples of what it can do:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prompt:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> green metal fish-shaped spaceship on an alien planet<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Styles:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> art, concept art, dramatic light, flat colors</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prompt: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->green hot rod racing through the desert<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Styles:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> photo, muted, blurry background, backlighting, science fiction</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Styles:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> art</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A couple of quick reflections on using Firefly‚Äôs Text to Image feature:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="text-effects">Text Effects</h3>
<p>Text Effects lets you specify and apply an AI-generated effect to some text. Firefly has a few sample effects that give you a good idea of what the feature can do. You can choose from 12 different fonts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prompt:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Green fluffy clouds, tight fit, transparent background</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prompt: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Circuit boards, tight fit, grey background</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prompt: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flowers and Rocks, loose fit, white background</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next?</h2>
<p>Adobe Firefly is definitely a work in progress ‚Äì it is a beta ‚Äì but there are more features in development. The Adobe Firefly site lists one feature as coming soon, Recolor Vectors. I‚Äôm not sure how that will differ from the Recolor Artwork feature in Adobe Illustrator, but I‚Äôm looking forward to trying it out. Several other features are teased as ‚ÄúIn exploration‚Äù and some of them look interesting. No idea how close to release these are ‚Äî for all I know, they are ideas on a white board ‚Äî but ‚Äútext to vector‚Äù and ‚Äúextend background‚Äù could be fun to play with. I‚Äôll likely write additional posts as new features are introduced.</p>

			 <h2 id="customize-your-navigation-with-filtered-categories">Customize your navigation with filtered categories</h2>
<p>When I first moved my blogging over to Micro.Blog, I struggled with the perceived rigidity of the navigation. It took me a little time to refine it, but I eventually figured it out. I‚Äôve had a couple of people ask about my solution, so I figured I‚Äôd share a quick summary of how I set it up my navigation.</p>
<p>It shouldn‚Äôt matter what theme you are using, but for my site, I use the <a href="https://github.com/chrishannah/Pure">Pure plug in</a>, which is a good foundation to build from. By default, the template presents a home page that includes all of your posts. Instead, I wanted to have different links in my navigation for my longer ‚Äúblog‚Äù posts and my shorter ‚Äútweet-like‚Äù status posts.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs actually pretty easy to do, but it takes a few steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Create the categories you want.</strong> I created two categories: Quick Updates and Long Posts. You can create as many categories or group them differently, but this worked for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set up filters.</strong> Filters will automatically apply categories based on different parameters. Click the ‚ÄúEdit Filters‚Äù button beneath the list of categories. I set up two filters. One that sorted untitled posts into my ‚ÄúQuick Thoughts‚Äù category and a second that grouped together all of my long posts with titles. This way, my posts are automatically grouped into one of the two categories. In the screenshot below, I used the &ldquo;Post Length&rdquo; setting.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine the URL for each category.</strong> Each category in Micro.Blog has a URL, typically formatted as <code>http://DOMAIN-NAME/categories/CATEGORY-NAME.</code> Find the URLs for each of the categories you want in the navigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a new page.</strong> Name the page and then paste the category URL into the content box.  Make sure ‚ÄúInclude this page in your blog navigation‚Äù is checked. Repeat for all of your categories. You‚Äôll then have a navigation item for each of your categories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This technique works really well when paired with the Custom Home Page plug in. You can see the result in the navigation <a href="http://www.bobwertz.com">on my site.</a> I know that I could do this by building a custom template. At some point, maybe I will. But right now, I&rsquo;d like to keep it as simple as I can, and this works really well for me.</p>

<p>One of my goals for this year is being healthier. Eating better. Moving more. The hope was that by breaking some bad habits I developed during COVID, I could lose some weight and feel better. I wanted to post occasional updates to keep myself accountable.</p>
<p>Two months in, things are going great. I feel significantly better ‚Äî that‚Äôs the ‚Äúmetric‚Äù I care about most ‚Äî and I‚Äôve dropped a significant amount of weight. I‚Äôm not doing any trendy diet or counting calories. I‚Äôve adapted some principles from intuitive eating.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I‚Äôm making smarter decisions about food and listening to my body. One example, I‚Äôve pretty much stopped drinking beverages with calories. At Starbucks, I get a black coffee or hot tea. Unsweetened tea instead of sweet tea.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I‚Äôm not drinking sodas. I‚Äôve generally avoided alcoholic drinks, but had a glass of bourbon at our Valentine‚Äôs Dinner. My energy level feels more consistent through the day without the sugary sodas and extra caffeine. And I‚Äôm sleeping better. Wins all around.</p>
<p>Exercise wise, I‚Äôm just focused on movement.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> I‚Äôm walking regularly. My wife and I have started taking long walks on the weekends, exploring the trails that are literally <a href="https://www.icrc.net/parks/mungo-park"><em>in our backyard.</em></a> I‚Äôm trying to walk at lunch and walk to meetings around campus. I‚Äôm not running on a treadmill ‚Äî or running at all. I might get to that point, but that‚Äôs down the road.</p>
<p>I do want to address the tech side of this. I purchased a <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus">Withings Body+</a> scale, and it syncs my weight to my Apple Health account. I use <a href="https://happyscale.com">Happy Scale</a> to track weight because it does a nice job of showing averages instead of just focusing on the lowest weigh in. I‚Äôm tracking activity and workouts with Apple Watch. I tend to be a data person, and I like having all these metrics. I just need to make sure I‚Äôm not fixated on the metrics. Again, the main goal is feeling better and developing healthy habits.</p>
<p>Two months in, I feel like I‚Äôm heading in the right direction. I‚Äôm making long-term lifestyle changes, and I know this is just a start. I plan to check back in here every month or so with an update.</p>

			 <h2 id="new-star-trek-means-new-characters">New Star Trek means new characters</h2>
<p>Star Trek is all about the characters and relationships on the ship. With all the new series on Paramount+, they&rsquo;ve introduced a bunch of interesting characters that I&rsquo;ve grown to love. With Season 3 of Star Trek: Picard starting next week, I figured I&rsquo;d share five new characters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬† who I&rsquo;m glad are part of the Star Wars Universe.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: A HANDFUL OF SPOILERS BELOW FOR DISCOVERY, STRANGE NEW WORLDS, PRODIGY AND LOWER DECKS.</strong></p>
<h3 id="ensign-sylvia-tillyhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikisylvia_tilly"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvia_Tilly">Ensign Sylvia Tilly</a></h3>
<p><em>Played by Mary Wiseman on Star Trek: Discovery.</em> When Star Trek first relaunched with Discovery, Tilly was such a different type of crew member. For all of the great Star Trek characters over the years, very few were quirky <em>and</em> likable.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬† Her relationships with Burnham, Stamets and Saru are wonderful. I wasn‚Äôt happy how they used her over the last season ‚Äî eventually shipping her off to Starfleet Academy ‚Äî but I hope next season includes a healthy dose of Tilly.</p>
<h3 id="rok-tahkhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikirok-tahk"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rok-Tahk">Rok-Tahk</a></h3>
<p><em>Voiced by Rylee Alazraqui on Star Trek: Prodigy.</em> If you haven‚Äôt seen Prodigy, you&rsquo;re missing out. Rok-Tahk is my favorite character from the crew. At first, Rok appears to be a fierce creature, but once the universal translator kicks in, you figure out that despite her intimidating form, she‚Äôs actually just a young girl with an interest in science. Her relationship with the Janeway hologram was encouraging and nurturing and I loved every minute of it. I look forward to seeing how she interacts with Admiral Janeway next season.</p>
<h3 id="christine-chapelhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikichristine_chapel"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Christine_Chapel">Christine Chapel</a></h3>
<p><em>Jes Bush on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.</em> I know Nurse Chapel appears in the Original Series and a couple of movies, but Jes Bush‚Äôs interpretation of the character is so different and distinctive. Chapel is incredibly smart and capable. And yes, she has a crush on Spock, but their relationship is much more nuanced and complex. We know where this character is heading, but I look forward to seeing how this version of Chapel develops.</p>
<h3 id="ensign-beckett-marinerhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikibeckett_mariner"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Beckett_Mariner">Ensign Beckett Mariner</a></h3>
<p><em>Voiced by Tawny Newsome on Star Trek: Lower Decks.</em> Lower Decks has so many great characters, but Mariner is my favorite. She‚Äôs a screw up, who also happens to be incredibly capable when she wants to be. Her relationship with her friends, her rivals and her mom are all complex and delightful. Depending on the episode, Beckett may create a massive problem ‚Äî or she could be the one to save the day. The end of last season was heartbreaking when her mom and friends thought she‚Äôd sold out the Cerritos crew. Many of the relationships were patched up in the finale, but I wonder if there will be lasting repercussions.</p>
<h3 id="captain-saruhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikisaru"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Saru">Captain Saru</a></h3>
<p><em>Doug Jones on Star Trek: Discovery.</em> Look, I know Captain Michael Burham is the star of the show, but Saru is the captain I‚Äôd want to serve under. Intelligent, thoughtful and competent. His personal backstory is wonderful, and I‚Äôm really interested to see his relationship with the leader of Vulcan develop. I‚Äôm not sure how Doug Jones can express so much emotion through all of that makeup. It‚Äôs seriously impressive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, while it&rsquo;s not a character, I want to give a shoutout to Lower Deck‚Äôs California class ships, especially the U.S.S. Cerritos. The idea that there are some <em>average</em> ships in the fleet is great. Other Star Trek shows focus on the glamorous flagship, but not every ship is the U.S.S. Enterprise.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Well&hellip; Five new and one reimagined.</li>
<li>You could argue that Barclay was quirky, but he was intentionally annoying. Neelix was intended to be quirky, but he was really just creepy.</li>

After looking at <a href="https://nownownow.com">a collection of now pages</a>, I realized that there isn&rsquo;t a single formula or approach. So for my first attempt, here&rsquo;s what I decided to add.</p>
<ul>
<li>What I&rsquo;m working on</li>
<li>Recently written</li>
<li>Recent media favorites</li>
<li>Active websites and profiles</li>
<li>Social media accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>I also moved the status of the fish in the header to this page. The fish changes from time to time based on my mood so that explanation makes more sense on my &ldquo;now&rdquo; page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my approach will change over time. Everything needs to be manually updated and I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll update every month or so.</p>

Most of my favorite online writers routinely share posts of various lengths, but I&rsquo;ve never changed my approach.

			 <h2 id="maybe-its-time-for-something-different">Maybe it‚Äôs time for something different.</h2>
<p>For years, I listened to local sports talk radio on my commute home. I live in the middle of SEC country, and ‚Äî especially during football season ‚Äî the talk shows were full of callers who were mostly annoying and overly opinionated.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬† The host of the show was great and I really enjoyed his commentary, so I kept listening. One day, after a particularly obnoxious sequence of callers, I tweeted something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love a sports talk show without callers‚Äù and tagged him. He responded, thanked me for listening, but said that most people didn‚Äôt want to listen to him talk for a couple of hours. They tuned in for the callers. That was the format.</p>
<p>Audience commentary is part of every type of media. With newspapers, we‚Äôve long had editorial pages, op-eds and letters to the editor. Radio has a whole sub-genre of talk radio that features callers giving their opinions and arguing with hosts. Television never really developed a feedback format because of obvious technical limitations, but developed something similar. Panel discussion shows are basically talk radio with a standard roster of characters, arguing with each other and representing viewer opinions.</p>
<p>The internet made commentary even easier. In the early days of the web, every news site and blog added comments to their stories to encourage feedback. The feedback quickly turned to meaningless noise, filled with extreme opinions and spam. Social media took it one step further. Facebook and Twitter are essentially <em>just</em> the comments section. Commentary <em>became</em> the media.</p>
<p>Some people love to read the letters to the editor and listen to talk radio. Many people ‚Äî judging by ratings ‚Äî watch television shows with a panel of guests arguing with each other about news or sports. There are people want to read the comments on news sites, although I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would subject themselves to that. And there are people who truly enjoy social media. This is all commentary-driven media.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve realized that I don‚Äôt like any of those things.</p>
<p>I like to read articles that provoke thought. I visit news sites and blogs that cover my (many) areas of interest. I use an RSS reader to track all of these sites. I follow photographers, videographers and creators who make original art. I listen to podcasts that add value and knowledge. I follow people on social media who are experts in their field, but I rarely respond or comment on their posts. Yes, I want to be entertained, but I also want to learn and be challenged. In contrast to the commentary-driven media, I suppose this is expert-driven media.</p>
<p>The reality is that most people prefer the commentary-driven approach. They feel part of the conversation. They can contribute if they want. They want to hear the opinions of others and argue about topics. Our current social media landscape was designed for them. They want to feel that their opinion is a vital part of the conversation. That is the format.</p>
<p>Cultivating an expert-driven media environment is tougher and it appeals to a smaller audience. But there <em>is</em> a significant audience. There are plenty of people who want to read posts and articles from people who know what they are talking about. An ample audience of people who want to listen to podcasts and watch informative videos. We just have to design a system that prioritizes meaningful content and encourages sharing well-thought out responses over quick, thoughtless knee-jerk commentary.</p>
<p>With the implosion of Twitter, I feel like we have an opportunity to build something different. I‚Äôm happy with Micro.Blog right now and look forward to its continued development. I‚Äôm interested in the resurgence of RSS <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬† and the momentum behind new indie-web protocols like ActivityPub. I‚Äôm encouraged that so many people are experimenting with different approaches to ‚Äúsocial‚Äù media. I can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next.</p>

			 <h2 id="trying-to-find-balance">Trying to find balance</h2>
<p>I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm not sure I ever found my footing after the pandemic shut everything down. I‚Äôve been trucking along keeping everything going, but the last half of 2022 was especially challenging. This rhythm and pace is not sustainable and it‚Äôs time to reset the balance between family, work and school.</p>
<p>Family is first, as always, but even more so now that my oldest is about to head off to college. I want to spend quality time with her before she moves out and heads to school. Work is going well, but is constantly busy. With graduate school, I‚Äôm taking the spring semester off to spend some time getting into a new routine.</p>
<p>For 2023, I need to focus on four areas: health, writing, organization and creativity.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-physical-and-mental-health">Focus on physical and mental health</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve got a list of things to work on ‚Äî from getting enough sleep to finding time to walk at lunch. I feel like I know what I need to do, but making time for a healthy life has been challenging over the last year. I need to develop consistent, healthy habits.</p>
<h3 id="write-more">Write more</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve been writing for school almost constantly for the last year. And that‚Äôs great, but it‚Äôs come at the expense of writing for myself. I‚Äôll still be writing for grad school, and hopefully getting some journal articles published this year, but I want to expand the type of writing I‚Äôm doing and improve my skills. Writing on bobwertz.com (via Micro.Blog) is going to be my primary personal writing outlet for the year.</p>
<h3 id="smartly-organized">Smartly organized</h3>
<p>In general, I‚Äôm organized, but there are some areas that are an absolute train wreck. I‚Äôm working on some using the tools I have ‚Äî like Notion and Tot ‚Äî more effectively. There‚Äôs a fine line here, though. Time spent on getting organized is time that I‚Äôm not working out, writing or designing.</p>
<h3 id="rediscover-creative-endeavors">Rediscover creative endeavors</h3>
<p>I‚Äôm a designer, but I‚Äôm not designing much right now. I have a bunch of projects, from stickers to typefaces that I want to work on. These always end up on the back burner when family commitments and grad school deadlines take priority. I need to carve out some time for visually creative projects that I‚Äôve been neglecting.</p>
<hr>
<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to hitting the reset button and restoring some balance to my slightly chaotic life. In past years, I‚Äôve shared a check-in post at the midpoint of the year to evaluate how I‚Äôm doing on my theme and goals. This year, I‚Äôm going to try and post quarterly to keep myself accountable.</p>

			 <h2 id="time-to-reset-the-balance">Time to reset the balance</h2>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you do it?‚Äù</p>
<p>I get this question a lot. I balance a full-time job, my family and grad school. I‚Äôve been in grad school part time since I started my Master‚Äôs program in 2018 and I‚Äôve become pretty good at carefully planning out and scheduling my time.</p>
<p>In 2022, I never really had a chance to achieve a balance. At work, there was a lot of change. My boss resigned in January and I assumed some of his responsibilities. I took over managing photography and videography staff again. <a href="https://sc.edu/uofsc/posts/2022/10/branding-streamline-announcement.php#.Y6CCCy-B2Lc">We rolled out a new logo,</a> which was ‚Äî and still is ‚Äî a lot of work. All of these things were positive developments, but required increasingly more of my time and attention.</p>
<p>At home, things were challenging. My wife tore her bicep in January and then had to have surgery in the summer, right as she was moving to a different school.  My oldest started her senior year of high school and is trying to figure out where she wants to go to college, but then tore her ACL in a lacrosse tournament and also had to have surgery. My two youngest each started a new school, which changed our morning routine significantly. Everyone is doing great, but there is always a lot going on.</p>
<p>And grad school has been <em>fine</em>. I‚Äôve done well. I‚Äôve written lots of papers that I am proud of and had research accepted to a conference. I‚Äôm trying to get my papers edited and submitted to journals. Classes have been good, but honestly, I haven‚Äôt enjoyed grad school for the last year. And that has been weighing on me.</p>
<p>The balance is off.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been in grad school part-time for 4.5 years straight at this point ‚Äî 3 for the Master‚Äôs and 1.5 for the Ph.D. With all the changes in my job and life, I wasn‚Äôt getting the most out of my Ph.D. studies.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬† So I‚Äôve decided to take the spring semester off. It‚Äôs a tough decision ‚Äî I‚Äôve been steadily working on my degrees one or two classes at a time ‚Äî but it‚Äôs the right decision. I need to pause and reset the balance between work, home and school. I‚Äôm not quitting, just taking a break. I know I‚Äôll start back up in the summer or fall, fully recharged and ready to continue to the finish.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>One of my professors told me that by working on my Ph.D. part time, I had the ‚Äúgift of time.‚Äù Most people have to sprint through their program so they can get a teaching job. By not rushing through my program, I could get the most out of it and enjoy it.</li>

			 <h2 id="testing-out-how-i-want-to-format-my-longer-posts">Testing out how I want to format my longer posts.</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had this Micro.Blog site for long, but I&rsquo;ve written at my other site &ndash; <a href="https://sketchbookb.com">Sketchbook B</a> &ndash; for almost 15 years.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬† Over time, my long form blog posts there developed a pattern. I had a basic structure with headers, footnotes, divider lines and a bio at the end. And I want to replicate some of that here and needed a post to experiment with. This is that post.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already been using an H2 as a subhead and I like the way that looks. Like many writers, I often want to add footnotes as I write. Over on Sketchbook B, I used asterisks, but since I&rsquo;m writing in Markdown, that&rsquo;s kind of a pain in the ass. So I figured I&rsquo;d go with superscript numbers, which is more conventional anyway.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬† I continue to use divider lines to separate the body of the post from the footnotes, and a second divider line between the footnotes and a bio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I want to do with the bio. I found that most of my traffic came from Google, so the reader was dropping in on my site with no idea who I was. For now, I&rsquo;ve decided to go with the shortest one sentence bio that I could and set it at the end in italics.</p>
<p>One aspect that I haven&rsquo;t yet decided on is images. On my Squarespace-hosted site, each post had a preview image and I&rsquo;d include a post image. So far on bobwertz.com, I don&rsquo;t need a preview image, but I do think I want to create some type of standard post image to include under the subhead. I&rsquo;ll keep experimenting, but I feel good about my basic post format.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to keep writing at Sketchbook B, but the content will be mostly Adobe Creative Cloud tips.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m using a trial of MarsEdit right now. And I really love the preview engine that lets me see how this is going to look, even before I post it. Looks like I&rsquo;ll be purchasing a license.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t love how the superscripts mess with the overall line spacing. It just feels wrong. I may try to come up with another approach.</li>

<p>This year was unexpected. Just about nothing went as planned ‚Äî sometimes better, sometimes worse. Looking back over my photos, I took fewer ‚Äúartsy‚Äù shots and mostly focused on my family. Here are my favorite shots from the past year, starting top left:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2022/d03bcd6149.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Evening snowfall.</strong> We don‚Äôt get much snow in Columbia, South Carolina. When it snowed in the evening in January, every thing was peaceful and serene‚Ä¶ and then it was fun and chaotic, when all neighborhood kids came outside to play in the snow.</p>
<p><strong>Norah‚Äôs prom.</strong> Our oldest headed to prom and had a great time with her friends.</p>
<p><strong>Jill‚Äôs birthday.</strong> There are nine candles on the cake. Not the correct number of candles, but the perfect amount of light.</p>
<p><strong>Soda City Market.</strong> We headed to our local market and took this picture as we were leaving. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what‚Äôs going on here ‚Äî Jill hugs her kettle corn while Ryan proudly presents a giant carrot ‚Äî but I love the shot.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan playing the viola.</strong> Ryan started playing the viola this year and seems to enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Sunrise at Hilton Head.</strong> Took a trip to Hilton Head with the family and woke up early enough to catch sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>Lizzy‚Äôs birthday selfie.</strong> Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ Our selfies are typically terrible and we have to take a bunch to get anything usable, but I grabbed this shot at Liz‚Äôs birthday dinner and we both like it. So it has to be one of my favorites.</p>
<p><strong>Skee-Ball.</strong> I love skee-ball, and this beautiful skee-ball machine was at the arcade where we had Ryan‚Äôs birthday party.</p>
<p>This is the fifth year I‚Äôve done a Favorite 8. You can see my previous posts from <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/12/27/fav8">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/12/14/fav-8-gt-best-9?rq=fav8">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2020/12/31/2020-fav8?rq=fav8">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2021/12/28/2021-fav8?rq=fav8">2021</a> on my other site, Sketchbook B.</p>

			 <h2 id="picking-out-my-favorite-pictures-from-the-last-year">Picking out my favorite pictures from the last year.</h2>
<p>Back in 2018, Instagram users started posting their algorithmically-generated ‚ÄúBest Nine‚Äù ‚Äî essentially the nine shots from the year that had the most likes. When I looked at mine, the images that everyone else liked weren‚Äôt necessarily my favorite pictures from the previous year. I enjoyed the process of digging through all the images from the previous year ‚Äî many of which I had forgotten about. I curated and built my #Fav8 in <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/12/27/fav8">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/12/14/fav-8-gt-best-9?rq=fav8">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2020/12/31/2020-fav8?rq=fav8">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2021/12/28/2021-fav8?rq=fav8">2021</a>. If you are interested in learning more about the thought process behind Favorite 8, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/12/27/fav8">the 2018 post</a> has the most detail.</p>
<p>This year, I‚Äôm not posting to Twitter, so I‚Äôm ditching the #Fav8 hashtag and just going with ‚ÄúFavorite 8.‚Äù Although on Micro.Blog, I‚Äôm thinking ‚ù§Ô∏è8Ô∏è‚É£ might be appropriate.</p>
<p>In the past, several friends have done this too, so this is just a reminder that it‚Äôs time to start working on selecting your Favorite 8 shots from 2022. I‚Äôll probably post mine next week.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs lots of hype about Mastodon as people flee Twitter, but lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about how brands will function on federated social sites.</p>
<p>If the big brands in the world are going to give Mastodon a shot, they aren‚Äôt going to just join an existing instance‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll host their own server for all of their related accounts. Let‚Äôs say you are a large international brand like Starbucks. Are you going to use @starbucks@mastodon.social? Not when you can have @official@starbucks.com, @news@starbucks.com, and @customercare@starbucks.com. If you run your own instance, you never have to worry about someone grabbing a handle you wanted to use. No worries about the content moderation policy on the instance you‚Äôve selected. And because of the way ActivityPub works, your posts will be visible across Mastodon and other compatible services. As a bonus, it‚Äôs much harder for a fraudulent account to spoof you if you connect your federated social account to your primary domain name.</p>
<p>(In reality, someone will create a service to manage this for brands and charge big money for it, because there is no way a corporate IT department is going to accept the risk of running a Mastodon instance.)</p>

			 <h2 id="content-is-more-important-than-commentary">Content is more important than commentary.</h2>
<p>When the internet was becoming popular, I remember being told that traditional media was just broadcasting. The internet promised more than just broadcasting, it offered ‚Äúengagement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt let people fool you. Engagement happened before the internet. People read the newspaper and talked about stories with their family and friends. They watched the evening news and discussed it at the water cooler at work the next day. They wrote letters to the editor to express their agreement or disapproval. They called radio shows to ask questions. They bought classified ads to share a job listing or sell a car. People engaged with media before the internet.</p>
<p>Instead, what the internet offered was an instant, two-way feedback loop between publisher and audience. Comments on blogs and news sites led the way. Then, social media provided the ultimate in real time engagement with metrics that let you track everything.</p>
<p>Instant response. Maximum engagement. Integrated with the content.</p>
<p>And how has that worked out? Thoughtful comments on blogs were quickly drowned out with spam. News sites were filled with reactionary opinions. Social media offered both reactionary opinions and spam <em>and as a bonus</em> channeled hate and harassment. Managing commentary takes as much staff and resources as creating the content, but people love providing their opinion and arguing their point of view, which drives traffic. And that traffic was the most important thing to the companies like Facebook and Twitter that sell the advertising that surrounds the hate.</p>
<p>As Twitter implodes and some people look for what‚Äôs next, I think we need to reexamine the relationship between publishing and engagement. Creation and commentary. True engagement is what follows when we create high-quality, beneficial content. We need to restore a focus on publishing the content, not just on the commentary. And our new technologies need to support that balance.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>P.S. One of the things I like about Micro.Blog is the absence of metrics. No follower counts. No likes. No retweets. If you are used to obsessively checking how many likes your last post got, the absence of metrics takes a little getting used to, but it resets the balance between publishing and engagement.</em></p>
<p><em>P.S.S. It occurs to me that the most profitable company in the world, Apple, creates a lot of content without maintaining a traditional social media presence.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m been an AIGA member for much of my professional career. I was active at a chapter level for over a decade. Over that time, people repeatedly tried to reimagine the central organization, its chapter system and its funding mechanisms. No one was ever satisfied. They wanted to make it better, and then <em>every designer</em> would want to join and <em>help change the world.</em></p>
<p>And yet, the organization got smaller.</p>
<p>AIGA has meant a lot to me and it definitely helped my career, but structurally, it‚Äôs been broken for a long time. It was built in a pre-Internet era. A time when the only way you got to see a legendary designer was to go to a conference or have them come to a local AIGA chapter. When networking was done primarily at the local bar. A time when being aligned with a large national organization gave you needed credibility and clout.</p>
<p>But now, YouTube means you can see all of your favorite designers deliver inspirational talks from the comfort of your own home. You can network with anyone, anywhere, anytime. The world changed, but the structure remained, and that was before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>AIGA isn‚Äôt alone. Lots of member-based organizations are trying to figure out how to move forward. These organizations can bring value to their members, but they will need to embrace a different approach, building valuable online communities that may or may not be connected with local chapters.</p>
<p>In the end, we‚Äôll see how AIGA&rsquo;s latest re-envisioning works out. I‚Äôm optimistic, but time will tell if they are able to make the hard choices.</p>

			 <h2 id="worth-every-penny">Worth every penny</h2>
<p>It seems like everything is going to subscription pricing. I subscribe to a whole host of streaming services, bundles, news sites, and software. Many of them don‚Äôt always seem worth the money, but as I look at what I subscribe to, I realize that I don‚Äôt mind supporting products and creators that I love. So here are a list of services that I really, really like and happily pay for:</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/"><strong>Micro.Blog</strong> <em>$5/month</em></a></p>
<p>I backed the Micro.Blog Kickstarter and I‚Äôve had a paid subscription ever since ‚Äî even when I wasn‚Äôt using it every day. I‚Äôm happy to support a product with a viewpoint that aligns with my values, and Micro.Blog is that type of service. Now that Twitter is unstable, I‚Äôm glad Micro.Blog is my home base.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade"><strong>Upgrade+</strong> <em>$5/month</em></a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve listened to Myke Hurley and Jason Snell talk about Apple and the larger tech industry on Upgrade since 2014. I listen to a lot of podcasts, but this is the one I listen to <em>every</em> Monday. Paying for the ‚Äú+‚Äù gets me ad-free episodes and an extra segment, but, I‚Äôm just happy to support a show I love.</p>
<p><a href="http://sixcolors.com"><strong>Six Colors</strong> <em>$6/month</em></a></p>
<p>Jason Snell and Dan Moren write Six Colors. I get additional articles and an extra podcast on Friday afternoons, but again, a way to support writers that I like. (Dan also writes a series of science fiction spy novels that I like a lot. <a href="https://dmoren.com/writing/galactic-cold-war/">Check them out, too.</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://ulysses.app"><strong>Ulysses</strong> <em>$29.99/year</em></a></p>
<p>A distraction-free writing app that lets me write in Markdown. I‚Äôve used Ulysses for a long time and almost everything I write starts here (including this post).</p>
<p><a href="https://fontstruct.com"><strong>Fontstruct</strong> <em>5‚Ç¨/month</em></a></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt spend a ton of time over on Fontstruct, but I love it dearly. Fontstruct lets you build modular fonts and export them. Tons of fun and a great community. It‚Äôs free to use, but the 5 euros helps pay the bills.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so"><strong>Notion</strong> <em>$5/month</em></a></p>
<p>Notion is‚Ä¶ a lot of different things in one package. I use it for tracking tasks, managing grad school projects, jotting notes and planning for the future. Well worth the $5 a month.</p>
<p><a href="http://zotero.org"><strong>Zotero</strong> <em>$20/year</em></a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm a Ph.D. student. Zotero is a citation manager that lets me track all of the sources I need for my papers. It‚Äôs not the prettiest app, but it‚Äôs incredibly powerful. Free to use, but by $20/year gets me more cloud storage. In a couple of years, I‚Äôll happily upgrade to the $60/year plan. Worth every penny.</p>

			 <h2 id="preparing-for-a-future-without-twitter">Preparing for a future without Twitter.</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve been preparing for the demise of Twitter since long before Elon Musk made the offer to purchase it. In 2016, I wrote a post ‚Äî <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2016/11/9/twitterless">Twitterless</a> ‚Äî about what would happen if Twitter ‚Äúdisappeared tomorrow.‚Äù I outlined a couple of key areas that would be problematic for me and possible solutions.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, I wrote a follow up post ‚Äî <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/3/twitterless-part-ii?rq=twitterless">Twitterless, Part II</a> ‚Äî that noted my progress on replacing the role Twitter plays for me, and the challenges that still existed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Times are changing, though, and I honestly believe that we all need to be diversifying ‚Äî and if possible, owning ‚Äî our social media presence. Becoming less reliant on the big social media behemoths is the first step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ended that post with a promise to follow up on my progress, but as Facebook became more and more evil, I focused <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/6/22/another-why-i-am-quitting-facebook-post?rq=facebook">on moving away from Facebook.</a> Replacing Twitter was pushed to the back burner.</p>
<p>Now that Twitter armageddon may or may not be here, it‚Äôs clearly time that I renew my quest to find an alternative. I figured I‚Äôd check back in on those questions that I asked back in 2016 and see how I‚Äôve done:</p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôd lose a bunch of contacts.</strong> Yep. I‚Äôm going to lose a bunch of people who follow me on Twitter. I‚Äôve tried to connect with people on other platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram, but I can‚Äôt find everyone, and you know what, I‚Äôm okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôd change how I watch live events.</strong> This is still a problem as <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/06/live-events-and.html">I noted yesterday.</a> Live events are fun to follow with other people, and Twitter is great for that. No other service is quite like Twitter for those instant commentary events.</p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôd have to rethink how I find articles and stories.</strong> I use <a href="http://www.feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> as an RSS reader, but that‚Äôs not my only solution. I subscribe directly to <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post.</em> And ‚Äî as shocking as it might seem ‚Äî I also get a lot of value out of Apple News+, which I get with our Apple One bundle. My local paper, <em>The State</em>, is included in with Apple News+ and I catch a random assortment of articles from sources I don‚Äôt normally read. It‚Äôs a nice way to diversify the news I see every day.</p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôd have to rethink how I share content.</strong> When I wrote this, I felt like traffic to my blog was coming primarily from Twitter, but over time, that lessened and most come through search engines. I‚Äôll still create and share, but I‚Äôll just use whatever channels are available at the time.</p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôd change the way I use Facebook/Instagram.</strong> I once thought that Facebook and Instagram might provide a solution. I‚Äôve mostly left Facebook, and Meta seems to only care about the Metaverse now anyway. I‚Äôm not that interested in Instagram now that it‚Äôs trying to be TikTok. I don‚Äôt feel any better about Facebook than I do about Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôd try to find a replacement.</strong> I backed the <a href="%5Bhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing%5D">Micro.Blog Kickstarter</a> back in 2017 and I‚Äôve had a paid account ever since. I originally <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/17/microblog-and-squarespace">connected Micro.Blog to my Squarespace site</a>, which worked well over the years. I believe in the idea of a feed-based, open social media platform, but because I was still using Twitter, I didn‚Äôt fully commit to using Micro.Blog.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve still got <a href="http://www.sketchbookb.com">Sketchbook B</a> and it‚Äôs still hosted on Squarespace, but I made the decision this summer that all of my future blog and short-form posting will be hosted on Micro.Blog, specifically, <a href="http://www.bobwertz.com">bobwertz.com</a>. Why? I love the community, and the platform lets me easily post my content and crosspost to other services if I want to. It also lets me follow people who post on Mastodon, and they can follow me at <a href="https://micro.blog/bobwertz@bobwertz.com">@bobwertz@bobwertz.com</a>. I like writing my blog posts in Ulysses in Markdown and the just post them directly to my site. I feel Micro.Blog gives me the best of all of the potential options and I‚Äôm happy with that choice.</p>
<p>Looking back, I think I‚Äôve prepared pretty well for the potential downfall of Twitter. I‚Äôm not leaving completely, but I‚Äôve got one foot out the door and I feel good about the solutions I‚Äôve worked out for me.</p>
<p>If Twitter ceases to be enjoyable, I‚Äôll leave. To be honest, I‚Äôll miss it. I joined in 2008 and 14 years is a long time to use any service. It‚Äôs part of my daily routine. At the end of the day, though, if a service isn‚Äôt making my life better, I‚Äôm better off without it.</p>

			 <p>One thing that Twitter excels at ‚Äî which will be difficult to replace ‚Äî is commentary during live events. Last night, I was able to follow a range of commentary on several college football games and the World Series all from my Twitter feed.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not just who I follow, it‚Äôs also the way the service is constructed. When following a bunch of live events, you need to use the non-algorithmic timeline. Twitter still, begrudgingly, allows for that. Facebook has many of the people I follow on Twitter, but the comments are jumbled, appearing whenever the algorithm decides, often incoherently out of order. And I can‚Äôt see following my South Carolina Gamecocks on another large service, like Linked In. ü§£</p>
<p>Perhaps the real question is if I need the stream of commentary at all? I get value out of live commentary from sports journalists and other fans. I feel like it ads to my enjoyment, but I enjoyed watching games before Twitter existed. Maybe live events is one of those areas where I need to reexamine my reliance on social media.</p>

			 <h2 id="two-notable-logo-trends-from-apple">Two notable logo trends from Apple</h2>
<p><em>This post was originally posted on April 22, 2021 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>Apple has one of the most recognizable logos in the world. Which isn‚Äôt surprising because they are the largest company in the world. I‚Äôve been watching a couple of trends over the last few months about how Apple uses their logos and this week, those trends have become even more apparent. For brand managers and designers, I think there is something interesting going on and it‚Äôs worth digging into the mystery.</p>
<h3 id="the-logo-is-missing">The logo is ‚Äúmissing.‚Äù</h3>
<p>Apple isn‚Äôt afraid to use their logos. All of their computers have prominent logos. They include logo stickers in all of their boxes. Apple‚Äôs logo is everywhere. But on their new iMac, which was released this week, Apple‚Äôs logo is on the back, but not on the front. The last few generations of iMac‚Äôs have featured a prominent logo on the back and a second logo on the ‚Äúchin,‚Äù facing the user. The new iMac has no user facing logo.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But the iMac isn‚Äôt the only recent Apple product with an interesting logo story. I first noticed Apple‚Äôs changing logo use with the introduction of the AirPod Max, which has no Apple logos at all on the product. There is plenty of room for a logo on the side of the headphones, but there is none to be found.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I guessed the AirPods Max was the only Apple product without a logo, but I was wrong. For some reason I assumed that my AirPods case had the Apple logo on it, but guess what? It doesn‚Äôt. I checked Apple‚Äôs website and the AirPods Pro don‚Äôt have a logo either. (Although according to Apple‚Äôs website and an iFixit teardown, the chip inside the AirPods Pro has a tiny logo printed on it.) My Apple Watch has a tiny Apple logo on the bottom on it, but it‚Äôs not visible when it‚Äôs being worn. Apple doesn‚Äôt include logos on any of their wearable products.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But that‚Äôs not all. I‚Äôve been trying out Apple Fitness+ and there are tons of visible logos. Nike logos. All of the instructors seem to be wearing Nike gear. There are no Apple logos. No special Apple Fitness+ shirts. No little Apple ‚Äúwatermark‚Äù in the corner of the screen. An Apple logo isn‚Äôt hidden somewhere on the set.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I checked Apple‚Äôs competitors. Amazon, Samsung and Microsoft all include their logo on the charging case for their AirPod competitors. Sony and Google even managed to get their logo on the earbud itself. None of the competing smartwatches that I looked at had logos, although Samsung etched ‚ÄúGalaxy Watch‚Äù into the crown for some reason.</p>
<p>In the fitness space, Peloton employees sport logo apparel while they lead classes. And the instructors on Nike‚Äôs fitness apps obviously sport Nike gear.</p>
<p>So what‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm not sure.</p>
<p>My first reaction is it‚Äôs just an issue of taste. Placing logos all over a product is tacky ‚Äî especially for wearables. And Apple is showing their superior taste by acknowledging that consumers don‚Äôt always want to be sporting company logos. Maybe? But lots of premium and luxury brands include logos on their products. And Apple isn‚Äôt exactly shy about using their logo.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not about the logo size. Even the Apple Pencil has a logo. And as I mentioned, the chips inside the AirPods have logos printed on them. (The chips‚Ä¶ inside the case‚Ä¶ that the consumer never sees‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>The absence of a logo is even stranger when you realize the original intent of a trademarked logo: to clearly identify the manufacturer. With a company like Apple, whose designs are ripped off more than about any other tech company, their logo is the part of the design that absolutely can‚Äôt be legally copied.</p>
<p>My best guess is that Apple thinks that their product designs are unique enough, that they don‚Äôt even need a logo. People will know AirPods are an Apple product when they see them. The Apple Fitness+ workouts feel like Apple even if their logo isn‚Äôt present. I don‚Äôt think any other company can make a desktop computer that looks like the new iMac. Apple‚Äôs presence is understood because of the overall production quality and design. A logo isn‚Äôt necessary.</p>
<h3 id="the-logo-is-incognito">The logo is ‚Äúincognito.‚Äù</h3>
<p>Typical corporate logo standards are incredibly strict. Apple doesn‚Äôt publish their internal brand guidelines, but it‚Äôs clear they do allow some more playful uses of their mark. For example, they often use illustrated versions of their logo to promote their media events, like they did for this week‚Äôs Spring Forward event. Allowing logo variations in large corporate identity systems isn‚Äôt uncommon, but those variations are typically used for structural identifications between organizational divisions or product lines.</p>
<p>But Apple is using logo variants that align with their values.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In 2014, Apple started using a logo with a green leaf in their retail stores on Earth Day. This logo seems to be used mostly in Apple retail, but showed up this week on the Apple home page for Earth Day 2021 and their updated environmental statement.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And in this week‚Äôs presentation, they showed their privacy Apple variation, which is often animated and turns the leaf at the top of their logo into a lock. It‚Äôs used in ads, videos and sites when Apple is talking about their commitment to privacy. What‚Äôs smart about this approach is that Apple is using their logo to not just communicate their identity, but also their corporate values.</p>
<p>(It‚Äôs worth noting that there are a couple of other logo variants as well: a gift that is used during the holidays and a version for their Marina Bay Sands retail store in Singapore. And I‚Äôm sure there are others as well.)</p>
<h3 id="what-lessons-can-we-take-from-apples-approach-to-logo-management">What lessons can we take from Apple‚Äôs approach to logo management?</h3>
<p>Apple‚Äôs visual branding is clearly effective. Repetition and consistency are the foundation of contemporary brand management, but Apple has decided to not use their logo in some places and change it in others. This ongoing shift in logo usage isn‚Äôt accidental or ill-considered. A couple of lessons to think about:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Everything doesn‚Äôt need a logo.</strong> In the 1990s, branding meant putting the logo on everything, but is it really necessary? (It isn‚Äôt.) Logos are important, but they aren‚Äôt the only way you communicate your identity. Apple‚Äôs using their logos smartly, and not over using their marks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Differentiation happens with the design around the logo.</strong> Apple‚Äôs products are identified by their look and feel. Yes, the logo is part of that, but Apple‚Äôs visual branding extends far beyond just their logo. Their brand is expressed as much through the surrounding elements ‚Äî type, color, materials ‚Äî as it is through their logo. Their visual differentiation extends far beyond just their logo and their identity is stronger for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think about how a visual identity can reflect a company‚Äôs values.</strong> Most of the time, visual identity reflects an organization‚Äôs structure, but connecting your visual brand to your corporate values is potentially more powerful. Apple uses logo variations that support their beliefs, not their hierarchy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We‚Äôll never hear from their branding team and Apple doesn‚Äôt publicly share their logo and branding guidelines. We‚Äôll just have to watch as they rollout ads, events and products. But it‚Äôs clear that Apple is diverging from the standard brand playbook here and I think we should pay attention to where they go next.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>This post was originally posted on July 4, 2019 on Sketchbook B. It‚Äôs reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>I grew up loving magazines. Any time I‚Äôd be interested in something, I‚Äôd head to the magazine aisle in the bookstore or grocery store and look for magazines on the topic. Computers, cars, boats, science, model railroads, photography, sports, baseball cards, comics, design and more. It didn‚Äôt matter what I was interested in, there was at least one magazine on the topic.</p>
<p>Growing up in the pre-internet days, these magazines provided the info I was looking for. Detailed, up-to-date, authoritative info about whatever geeky habits I was interested in. Even the ads were informative and useful. I subscribed to some of them. Others, I‚Äôd buy if the main topics that month interested me.</p>
<p>The internet destroyed these publications. The first blow came from blogs. Authoritative people writing about the things they loved that people could read for free. The second blow was Google, which could route you to exactly what you were looking for. For various reasons ‚Äî mostly related to monetization ‚Äî the blog revolution failed to really take hold. Google‚Äôs search engine algorithm seemed to reward people with better SEO tactics over more authoritative sources. When I search Google for resources today, it‚Äôs hard to tell if what I‚Äôve found is up-to-date or reputable. More often than not, I‚Äôm led to dated post of questionable origin that barely answers my question.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I was excited about the introduction of Apple News+. Access to hundreds of magazines for $10 a month. The service is nothing world-changing. I‚Äôve absolutely gotten my money‚Äôs worth and will continue to subscribe. Surprisingly, though, I discovered I‚Äôd already filled the need for a detailed, up-to-date, authoritative source for my geeky habits: podcasting.</p>
<p>I use podcasts the same way I used special interest magazines as a kid.</p>
<p>If I‚Äôm interested in a topic, I find a podcast. Computers, design, photography, business, pens, science fiction, pop culture, sports, meditation and more. I subscribe to many of these podcasts in Overcast<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, while others I only listen to a few episodes. Even the ads are informative and relevant. Podcasts are how I learn about and explore new topics.</p>
<p>Some people think of podcasting as an evolution of talk radio. Others feel it‚Äôs more an audio form of blogging. I suppose I don‚Äôt have an issue with either of those opinions, but for me, podcasts serve a vital role as a replacement for the special interest magazine.</p>

<p><em>This post was originally posted on January 13, 2019 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about the language we use to talk about social media and content creation on the web. And as I‚Äôm writing about social media ‚Äî especially microblogging and the indie web movement ‚Äî I feel like we need a phrase to refer to platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and others that try to lock in users and leverage their private data to sell more ads, compared to the other newer services with revenue models that are less interested in ad sales or lock in.</p>
<p>I know that we already use ‚Äúindie‚Äù and ‚Äúindie web‚Äù as a way to differentiate between the two approaches, but I‚Äôm not sure that meaning is clear to a broader audience.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to go with ‚Äúcaptive social‚Äù and ‚Äúopen social.‚Äù</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Captive Social.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Social media networks and services that make money through advertising, leveraging their user‚Äôs private data. Captive social networks benefit from gathering as much data on their users as possible and using that data to sell more relevant ads to users. To be profitable, that also means that they benefit from having users spend as much time as possible engaged with their platform. Examples of captive social networks: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linked In, Snapchat.</p>
<p>I think my time in the insurance industry has partially inspired this terminology. Captive insurance agents are contractually obligated to only sell products from a single vendor. But I think the term is appropriate for the relationships we have with social media platforms. We are locked into each service silo with very little interoperability between competing platforms.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Social.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Newer social media networks that are aren‚Äôt interested in trapping your data. They benefit from interoperability and the sharing of data between services. Their profitability isn‚Äôt based on leveraging personal user data, but on the value you derive from the service.</p>
<p>The inspiration for the terminology isn‚Äôt open source, it‚Äôs open web standards. I was a Mac user during the years of Internet Explorer dominance ‚Äî when you sometimes couldn‚Äôt access a web site if you didn‚Äôt have the right browser. The open web standards push in the early 2000‚Äôs freed us from that nightmare and led to expanded browser choice. I hope that open social can have a similar effect on social media that open web standards had on the web.</p>
<p>Open social does have a distinct meaning from indie web. Indie web aims to separate itself from the corporate web, but open social is not necessarily limited to only small companies and decentralized platforms. A large corporation could build an open social platform, as long as they weren‚Äôt profiting from trapping your data and locking you into their service.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The difference isn‚Äôt the size of the provider, but instead, their goals, objectives and business models.</p>
<p>So here are a couple of examples of captive social and open social in context:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt know why you spend so much time on those captive social sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm going to focus on open social platforms like Micro.Blog and limit the time I spend on captive social sites like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hopefully, open social platforms will have the same impact on the web that the open web standards movement did.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs a subtle change ‚Äî a language shift that I think will help when we are having discussions with people who are concerned about privacy and the power of social media, but who aren‚Äôt comfortable hosting their sites or maintaining a server.</p>

			 <h3 id="designers-dont-want-to-admit-it-but-math-is-important-to-the-profession">Designers don‚Äôt want to admit it, but math is important to the profession.</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>This post was originally posted on September 29, 2015 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>My first class in graduate school was a quantitive research class and I really enjoyed the statistics side of things. As I‚Äôve told my designer friends this, they typically respond with something along the lines of ‚ÄúUgh. I became a designer so I wouldn‚Äôt have to do math.‚Äù I‚Äôm not surprised. I‚Äôve heard the same from designers and students over the years, but I‚Äôm increasingly irritated by it for a few reasons:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designers use math every day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I‚Äôm not sure where the myth that designers don‚Äôt need to understand math comes from, but it‚Äôs not true.  I use math pretty much every day in my work. Especially geometry and algebra. Understanding foundational mathematical concepts makes you a better designer.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It steers talent away from the field.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve got a talented high school kid, who also happens to be good at ‚Äî or maybe even like ‚Äî math. Tell them enough times that math isn‚Äôt important for designers and they‚Äôll find a different career path. As an honors student, I was told repeatedly through school by well-meaning adults that I didn‚Äôt want to take art classes because they weren‚Äôt rigorous enough. As a result, I initially looked at options like architecture and engineering. It took me a while to circle around to design.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It undermines the profession.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The reality is that designers struggle to be taken seriously by big business. We‚Äôve fought to get a ‚Äúseat at the table‚Äù and prove our value beyond just crafting the look and feel of something. As much as we don‚Äôt like it, the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù of business is often based in math. Ignoring the importance of math simply makes it harder to communicate with business decision makers.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think the challenge is separating our feelings about ‚Äúmath class‚Äù from our feelings about ‚Äúmath.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt enjoy most of my high school math classes. My algebra and geometry teachers weren‚Äôt my favorites. Because I scored a high enough score on my AP Calculus test, I was able to exempt all of my college math requirements, so I haven‚Äôt taken a math class in almost 25 years. What I‚Äôve come to realize is that while I disliked the way I was taught math, math itself is pretty amazing. And useful.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt misunderstand me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not expecting designers to line up and take refresher math classes. AIGA chapters aren‚Äôt going to start holding day-long math workshops. All I‚Äôm saying is that embracing the idea that math is an integral part of design only helps the profession as a whole.</p>

<p>The bathroom at my office has four sinks and three soap dispensers. Each soap dispenser has a clear plastic front so the cleaning crew can see how much liquid pink soap is left and refill it if necessary.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the first two soap dispensers are low on soap, but the last one, furthest from the door never seems to be low on soap.</p>
<p>You could draw conclusions from this single data point that no one uses the dispenser. And you would be right.</p>
<p>But why? Maybe people prefer the sinks closer to the door? Maybe it‚Äôs not in the most convenient location? Maybe there are too many soap dispensers?</p>
<p>The soap dispenser is broken. It hasn‚Äôt worked in at least 8 months.</p>
<p>But I imagine the cleaning crew has no idea. They are only looking at that one indicator: Is there soap in the dispenser?</p>
<p>Just a reminder that often, our data tells us what‚Äôs happening, but not necessarily why.</p>

<p>I made a red velvet cake last week.</p>
<p>From scratch. It was a recipe that my mom made when I was growing up, but it was originally my Grandmother Wertz‚Äôs recipe. My grandmother died when I was very young, so to me, red velvet always makes me think of my mom.</p>
<p>My mom passed away almost 17 years ago. She taught me to cook many things, but this red velvet cake was not one of them. All I knew was that it was difficult, and that she messed up the icing the first time she tried to make it. I can make pretty much anything that she made, but I had never tried to make the red velvet cake. I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äì I was scared. Scared to fail. Afraid that if I messed it up, I wouldn‚Äôt have someone to call for advice. I was on my own. So I never attempted it.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I started thinking about making her red velvet cake. I don‚Äôt know what triggered my urge to bake the unbakeable, but I couldn‚Äôt get the idea out of my head. I got the recipe from my sister and decided to bake the cake Christmas Eve. (Because obviously, we had nothing else to do that night‚Ä¶) I ran to the grocery store and got the ingredients. I found our fanciest cake stand. And I pulled out the Kitchen Aid mixer that my parents gave us as a wedding gift.</p>
<p>The recipe wasn‚Äôt that hard, but like most older recipes, it was procedural. Lots of steps and precise measurements. The cake batter came together okay, but the icing was another story. This recipe doesn‚Äôt use a cream cheese icing like a lot of modern red velvet cakes do. It‚Äôs more like a butter cream. I ruined the first batch of icing and had to make a second batch. About 1:00 Christmas morning, I finished icing the cake. It looked exactly like I remembered.</p>
<p>Christmas evening, after dinner, we cut into the red velvet cake ‚Äì giant pie-sized wedges like my mom used to cut. It tasted like I remembered. Not too sweet, perfect texture. Even the kids loved it. I will freely admit that I teared up a little upon realizing that I had successfully pulled it off.</p>
<p>As I think about the year ahead, I realize that many of the things I‚Äôve been scared of‚Ä¶ many of the things I‚Äôve put off attempting‚Ä¶ the fear is all in my head. In 2018, I‚Äôm going to put those fears aside, branch out and try new things.</p>
<p>(And now that I can make the red velvet cake, I‚Äôm definitely going to bake it again.)</p>

			 <h2 id="a-year-ago-i-decided-to-lessen-my-reliance-on-twitter-heres-my-progress-so-far">A year ago, I decided to lessen my reliance on Twitter. Here&rsquo;s my progress so far&hellip;</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>This post was originally posted on January 3, 2018 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>A little over a year ago, <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2016/11/09/twitterless.html">I wrote a blog post pondering what would change in my workflow if Twitter disappeared.</a> At the time, Twitter was actively looking for buyers and had just shut down Vine. I identified what I would miss without Twitter and decided to start looking for options to address some potential pain points.</p>
<p>In the last year, the narrative has shifted from Twitter‚Äôs possible sale to issues with abuse and hatred. Twitter increased the character count to 280 and that‚Äôs worked out fine, but its user growth is still flat. As Twitter tries to jumpstart the service, I still believe the likelihood of Twitter imploding within the next few years is high.</p>
<p>I thought I‚Äôd revisit my areas of concern <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2016/11/09/twitterless.html">from my previous post</a> and share what I‚Äôve done to mitigate those issues.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd lose a bunch of contacts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> My first concern was that I‚Äôd lose a bunch of contacts that I only had on Twitter. I‚Äôm a little less concerned about this than I was a year ago. I‚Äôve slowly started to connect with more people, experts and brands on other services like LinkedIn and Facebook. I‚Äôve still got a ways to go and will continue to expand the roster of people I follow on other services.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd change how I watch live events.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I‚Äôm still using Twitter during live events. For me, this is the hardest to replace. During the Sugar Bowl and the Rose Bowl this week,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I kept up with commentary from reporters and friends on Twitter. Following commentary on live events is challenging through Facebook. Posts don‚Äôt appear in sequential order because of their algorithm.</p>
<p>Twitter is simply the best option to handle streaming written commentary during an event. I‚Äôm sure I could use something like Snapchat, but I don‚Äôt know enough people on Snapchat for it to be useful for me.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd have to rethink how I find articles and stories.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This was a big issue for me, but I‚Äôve kind of solved it‚Ä¶ by cheating a little bit. I‚Äôve started using Nuzzel<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> to surface headlines from my social media services. Not familiar with Nuzzel? It‚Äôs a pretty simple service. You connect your social media services ‚Äî Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn ‚Äî and Nuzzel tells you what links your friends (and friends of your friends) are sharing. This works really well for finding the links and articles that your social circle is talking about‚Ä¶ without actually going into Twitter or Facebook. It‚Äôs cheating because 95% of the links that come up are from people I follow on Twitter. I really like the service and I see lots of links I would have otherwise missed. I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve upgraded to Feedly Pro and I‚Äôm being more intentional about subscribing to interesting RSS feeds. I‚Äôm going to continue to expand my use of Feedly.</p>
<p>I find Facebook useless for finding actual news stories unless I want to know ‚Äú27 Secrets from The Last Jedi‚Äù or some crappy, clickbait slideshow link. And LinkedIn seems equally useless for finding content that I‚Äôm interested in.</p>
<p>I need to give Medium another chance, but for some reason, I just haven‚Äôt been interested in building an account on Medium with people I follow and read regularly. Maybe that‚Äôs something to look into more in 2018.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd have to rethink how I share content.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Sharing the content I create is another issue. I‚Äôm sharing more widely on other services, but I‚Äôm still using Twitter. For 2018, I‚Äôm shifting most of my short format posting to Micro.Blog with automatic cross posting to Twitter.</p>
<p>And to promote most of my blog posts or interesting content, I schedule posts through Buffer to several different services.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve thought about reposting my blog posts and articles on Medium, but it seems like a lot of work to post everything twice. (And only posting to Medium is not an option for me. I want everything hosted on my site.) I may try Medium again.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve tried and I‚Äôve tried, but I can‚Äôt get into Dribbble. I love the concept and I love the community, but it just doesn‚Äôt match up with the way I work. Still, the community is great so maybe I‚Äôll give it another shot in 2018.</p>
<p>And finally, Pinterest. For some of my content ‚Äî specifically my shirt and product designs ‚Äî Pinterest is a great service. But I haven‚Äôt really spent that much time in Pinterest personally, so that might be another avenue I explore in 2018.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd change the way I use Facebook.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> So Facebook‚Ä¶ I really do think that we‚Äôve reached the point where you have to have a Facebook account, unfortunately. In today‚Äôs communications environment, Facebook is a necessary evil. Over the last year, Facebook has had its own problems with hatred, fake news and discrimination, though, and I&rsquo;d love to reduce my reliance on Facebook, too.</p>
<p>Facebook is a great place to share family photos, but for serious content, I don‚Äôt think it works well. I‚Äôve started to build an audience for the Sketchbook B Facebook page and I‚Äôm going to continue to promote the page and hopefully expand the number of followers. That said, I feel like Facebook‚Äôs algorithm is going to hide my content unless I pay to promote it, which I may start to do selectively.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd spend more time on Instagram.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I still love Instagram.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> A couple years ago, I switched my account from a personal account to a business account. The bonus was that I could see viewer metrics, but the drawback was that it would only let me cross post to my Facebook Sketchbook B business page, not my personal profile. Since most of my Instagram shots are family or fun shots, I want to cross post those to my personal Facebook page. I don‚Äôt really care about metrics so I recently switched back to the personal account.</p>
<p>I plan to cross post my fun family Instagram images to Twitter and Facebook more regularly. I also plan to manually repost from Instagram to Micro.Blog. It‚Äôs a little bit of work, but I like having everything on my site.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd try to find a replacement.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> A little over a year ago, I was guessing that if Twitter disappeared, someone would rise up and meet the needs of its former user base. I didn‚Äôt have to wait until Twitter disappeared. A few months after I wrote my post, Manton Reece launched his Micro.Blog Kickstarter project. Micro.Blog is a service that allows me to host my microblog posts ‚Äî basically, tweets ‚Äî on my own site and then share through a social media service. Manton‚Äôs done a great job so far, and I really think that Micro.Blog is the tip of the iceberg for a resurgence of the independent web. The service isn‚Äôt for everyone and it‚Äôs in the early days. Manton is still figuring out how some features will work, but I think it‚Äôs a great fit for me. (I‚Äôm going to write a lot more about Micro.Blog this month, including why I‚Äôm excited about it, and detailing how I configured my Squarespace blog to work with Micro.Blog.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reality check.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I‚Äôm not completely giving up on Twitter, though. I‚Äôve been a Twitter user since 2007 and Twitter is part of my daily routine. It&rsquo;s just a less enjoyable part of my daily routine now. This year, I backed Twitteriffic for Mac on Kickstarter because I wanted my favorite Twitter client on my Mac.</p>
<p>Times are changing, though, and I honestly believe that we all need to be diversifying ‚Äî and if possible, owning ‚Äî our social media presence. Becoming less reliant on the big social media behemoths is the first step.</p>
<p>I look forward to revisiting my progress next year.</p>

<p>Every place we work has its own dysfunctional elements. And when you change jobs, you move from one group of challenges to another. Every job has challenges. You choose which challenges you&rsquo;ll face.</p>
<p>I had coffee a couple of months ago with some friends and one of them was in the midst of a job search. I relayed my standard &ldquo;choose your dysfunction&rdquo; advice. One of our friends piped up:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I think that sometimes, we bring our dysfunction with us.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t been able to get that thought out of my head.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true that each job brings unique challenges. But it&rsquo;s equally true the we cause many of our own issues. Too often, we blame the environment around us for something that we, ourselves, are causing.</p>
<p>The key to addressing those issues ‚Äì to finding happiness or fulfillment or whatever you are looking for ‚Äì is being able to tell the difference between the dysfunction you find and dysfunction you carry with you.</p>

<p><em>This post was originally posted on November 9, 2016 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I‚Äôve been on Twitter since 2007. It‚Äôs part of my daily routine and probably my most vital social media channel for finding and sharing news. But Twitter has had some lingering financial issues and when they recently tried to sell the company, no one stepped up to make an appropriate offer.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, a couple of social media experiments have crashed and burned lately. Twitter announced that they were closing Vine.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Talkshow had a bunch of potential but didn‚Äôt make it six months. And while Twitter is much larger, it‚Äôs not immune from financial reality.</p>
<p>Which got me thinking, what if we woke up one morning and Twitter was gone. Or more likely, what if Twitter changed so radically, that it was unusable? How would that change the way I get things done?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd lose a bunch of contacts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I follow a large number of designers, brands and local experts on Twitter ‚Äî and no where else. If Twitter disappeared, I‚Äôd lose all those contacts and have to try and reconstruct the network on another channel. Not an easy task.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd change how I watch live events.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> During the World Series, I kept an eye on Twitter. During the presidential debates, I followed along on Twitter. During the University of South Carolina&rsquo;s football game last weekend, I kept up with the score on Twitter. During election night coverage, sigh. Twitter is the perfect companion to a live event and I‚Äôd miss seeing what my friends and family think in real time.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd have to rethink how I find articles and stories.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I find lots of inspirational links and content on Twitter. If Twitter goes away, I‚Äôm using RSS and Feedly much more aggressively.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd have to rethink how I share content.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I share most of my blog posts through Twitter. If Twitter were gone, I‚Äôd have to share them somewhere else like Facebook or Medium.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd change the way I use Facebook.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I use Facebook for family pictures and connecting with people I know and have met. If Twitter disappeared, I‚Äôd probably use Facebook more to connect with a wider audience. Maybe I‚Äôd invest more time into building the Sketchbook B page on Facebook. Post more links to articles on my Facebook feed. If Twitter goes away, my Facebook experience changes radically.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd spend more time on Instagram.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Because I love Instagram, almost as much as I love Twitter. And I‚Äôm going to have some free time if there is no Twitter.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôd try to find a replacement.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If Twitter disappeared, I imagine several companies would rush to unveil a replacement. Or modify their social product to attract Twitter refugees. You know Google would retool and rebrand Google Plus, Linked In might try to be less of a train wreck. Even Snapchat might try to appeal to former Twitter users. Startups would start, and fail. Someone would try to resurrect App.net. I‚Äôd try them all, but I‚Äôm not sure there can truly be a replacement for Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="but-reality">But‚Ä¶ reality.</h3>
<p>So I don‚Äôt think Twitter will just shut down. At some point, the price to purchase the company gets so low, that someone will take a chance on them. I‚Äôm more concerned that Twitter, or a company that buys Twitter, will change it so completely, that it becomes useless.</p>
<p>This exercise had forced me, though, to start evaluating areas where I am too reliant on Twitter. I&rsquo;m going to start connecting to designers and thought leaders on other channels. I&rsquo;m looking for new avenues to find and share content. I&rsquo;ll evaluate how I use channels like Facebook, Instagram, Dribbble, YouTube and Medium.</p>
<p>Twitter might not disappear, but it&rsquo;s still best not to keep your eggs in one basket.</p>

<p><em>This post was originally posted on September 12, 2016 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<h2 id="real-jobs-have-deadlines">Real jobs have deadlines.</h2>
<p>As a designer, I hear &ldquo;As Soon As Possible&rdquo; an awful lot. Most people are shocked to learn that ASAP is actually my lowest priority. Jobs with concrete deadlines are always in line ahead of jobs with no real deadline.</p>
<p>Understanding why the client needs something ASAP is the first step in understanding whether you are dealing with a crisis or a &ldquo;crisis.&rdquo; There are a couple of reasons why clients avoid giving you a real deadline:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When can you get it to me? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the client is asking you to set a deadline, the project probably doesn&rsquo;t have a firm due date. It likely needs to be done quickly, but they don&rsquo;t want to look stupid and throw out a date that is impossible. Or they are hesitant to suggest a date that is too far out in the future. So they throw it back to you. In that case, sit down and start developing a schedule that works for everyone. If they need it faster, they&rsquo;ll let you know in the process of setting the timeline.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a rush!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> For some clients, everything is a rush. Every email is marked high priority. So don&rsquo;t overreact and rush into the project. Ask for a specific timeline. This is client&rsquo;s normal operating procedure so stick to yours. If it&rsquo;s a real rush, they will tell you.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s going to take forever!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Some clients have no idea how long a project is going to take. So they are anxious to get started. Asking for a deadline will diagnose that immediately. I once had a client call in a panic and rushed over to meet them only to find out that we had four months to complete a simple poster series. Crisis averted.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My boss wants it now! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sometimes, the client is panicked because their boss is on their back. They may not even know when the project is really needed. Work with them to set a schedule to share with their manager. Have them confirm the schedule will meet the manager&rsquo;s needs and get back to you. 99% of the time, the manager will be fine with the schedule.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I need it yesterday! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some clients ask for the world. And the ability to travel back in time. Setting a timeline is important here, but so are problem solving skills. I&rsquo;ve seen clients ask for 50,000 brochures on a very short turn, only to find out it was because they needed 1,000 for a trade show. (We ran the 1,000. Then ran the larger print run later.) The clients are typically panicked and aren&rsquo;t thinking straight. By focusing on the timeline, you can help them figure out what they really need and give them the best solution for their problem.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the client really is asking for the impossible. Tell them. But here&rsquo;s the key, after you tell them that you can&rsquo;t meet their deadline, tell them what you can do for them.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oops! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sometimes the client makes a mistake and forgets to make a request or communicate a deadline. And this is where you can play the hero. Set a timeline for how to get them what they need and do your best to help them out.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designers drop the ball sometimes, too.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If it&rsquo;s your fault, apologize and own the mistake. Then, move heaven and earth to make it right.</p>
<p>In every single one of these scenarios, communication is key. Be up front about the schedule, challenges and costs. Remember that the client is often under a lot of pressure and may not be thinking straight. Most importantly, don&rsquo;t take the ASAP request personally.

<p>All professionals need a personalized email address and a home on the web. And Gmail accounts and Facebook pages don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>I saw a branding consultant recently without a branded email address. Who hires a brand consultant who doesn&rsquo;t invest in their own brand?
I saw a company trying to recruit managers&hellip; just email an AOL account. (In case you are wondering, the company wasn&rsquo;t recruiting for AOL.)
I was trying to find out information on a store in town and all they had was a Facebook page that hadn&rsquo;t been updated in a couple of months.
I don&rsquo;t really care what your business is ‚Äî from a home-based business to a large corporation ‚Äî if you don&rsquo;t have a real email address with your own domain name, I&rsquo;m less likely to take you seriously. And if your only web presence is a Facebook page, you don&rsquo;t have a real business.</p>
<p>Look. I get it. It&rsquo;s easy to get by with the free accounts. A penny saved is a penny earned. Absolutely. But investing in a domain name and a Google apps account? It&rsquo;s not that expensive. Without your own domain, you send a message to all your clients and potential clients that you can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t invest in your own company.</p>
<p>It used to take some effort to get on the Web a decade ago, but now, services like Squarespace provide great solutions for small businesses and take care of hosting, e-commerce and more. Like Gmail? That&rsquo;s fine. You can customize your address with Google Apps. Other services like Hover can help you get your domain and email set up. There are seriously hundreds of services to help you look professional. It&rsquo;s not that hard and not that expensive.</p>
<p>Having a professional online appearance is every bit as important as dressing appropriately or speaking intelligently. It&rsquo;s a necessary investment that lets people know that you are serious about your business.</p>
<p>Unless you aren&rsquo;t serious about your business. And then, I guess, any email address or website will do.</p>

<p>I get asked a lot what it‚Äôs like to have three kids. Mostly from people with two kids thinking about whether they want to have another. Sometimes, the question comes from younger couples who are thinking about having kids.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And I always struggle to answer.</p>
<p>My standard answer is that when you have three kids, you have to switch from man-to-man to zone. You lose a little control. You are outnumbered. And while that is completely accurate, it sounds scary and intimidating, which isn‚Äôt at all what I want to communicate. I love having three kids.</p>
<p>My other answer is that with three kids, how far apart they are really matters. I‚Äôve had friends with three kids under four years old. For us, our oldest was seven when her brother was born. Those are two radically different situations. But that doesn&rsquo;t really answer the question.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, an interaction with the kids gave me the answer I was missing. We were waking up and getting ready for church.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Middle child:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> What are we doing for breakfast?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Me:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I don‚Äôt know. We‚Äôll probably have a small breakfast now and maybe go to brunch after church.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Youngest:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> WHAT! We can‚Äôt go to a restaurant! We need to go to church! (He LOVES Sunday School.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Me:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> We are going to church. We might go out to eat after church.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Youngest: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why can‚Äôt we eat at church?</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oldest (from another room):<!-- raw HTML omitted --> We‚Äôre having breakfast at church?!?</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like having three kids ‚Äî like adding a person to a game of telephone. It gets a little bit crazier. Funnier. Unpredictable. Often delightful and occasionally frustrating. But never boring.</p>

<p><em>This post was originally posted on September 29, 2015 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>A few years ago, I stopped at a fast food restaurant in rural, upstate South Carolina where a car was circling the drive thru over and over and over. She‚Äôd drive up to the ordering station and wait a second. Then the car would drive to the window, pause, and then drive around again. This happened a couple of times. It was very strange.</p>
<p>When I walked in, I nodded toward the car at the window and asked what was going on. The woman shrugged, obviously embarrassed, and said ‚ÄúJust improving the drive thru wait times‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>Lots of people wonder how something like the Volkswagen <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> emissions test scandal can happen. It‚Äôs actually very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a specific goal.</li>
<li>Figure out a test to measure it: a survey, a timer, a standardized test, etc.</li>
<li>Make sure everyone knows how important the test is.</li>
<li>Provide rewards for people who achieve the test objectives. And penalize people who don‚Äôt meet the test objectives.</li>
<li>Smart people will eventually figure out how to do well on the test, even if it now has nothing to do with the original goal.</li>
<li>Management pats themselves on the back for great test results.</li>
<li>The test no longer reflects reality.</li>
</ol>
<p>This cycle is everywhere in business today and manifests itself in different ways. Most of the time, it doesn&rsquo;t involve fraud and cheating. But this process is why:</p>
<ol>
<li>Engineers design products (cars, cell phones, etc.) that meet specific test objectives, but not real life usage.</li>
<li>Customer service reps in banks, car dealerships and retail stores remind you over and over to answer ‚Äúhighly satisfied‚Äù on a random survey.</li>
<li>Teachers teach to the test.</li>
<li>Managers make short sighted decisions to stay under budget.</li>
<li>Advertisers make really annoying online ads to improve click through rates.</li>
<li>Fast food workers fake drive thru response times.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you connect success on a metric to an employee‚Äôs financial well being, that employee will change their behavior to meet the test objectives. And yes, sometimes, if the pressure is great enough, they cheat.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sure those fast food workers wanted to have good drive thru response times to make their boss happy. I doubt there was a financial incentive. Maybe if the boss was happy, their life would be easier. Or perhaps they were afraid of being fired. Whatever the reason, they cheated to meet their test objectives. They lost sight of ‚Äî or more likely, were never told ‚Äî the reason for the test.</p>
<p>The test itself isn‚Äôt the problem. Testing and evaluation is a key part of management in a corporate environment. But today, it‚Äôs really easy to test and measure everything. Over reliance on metrics in management makes the test more important than the goal. And that never ends well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll simply get what you test for.</p>

<p>Why are so many people and organizations obsessed with acronyms? Especially acronyms that spell another word. From small nonprofits and churches to schools and large corporations, really bad acronyms are everywhere.</p>
<p>NASA&rsquo;s Messenger Probe crashed into Mercury after a long and successful mission. And as I read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/30/us/nasa-mercury-messenger-space-probe-to-crash/index.html">CNN&rsquo;s account of the mission</a>, I was stunned by the fifth paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6¬Ω years before it started circling Mercury on March 18, 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait. So the Messenger probe is actually M.E.S.S.E.N.G.E.R.? Or is it Me.S.S.En.Ge.R.?</p>
<p>NASA designed a space probe to fly to a planet named after the messenger of the gods. And NASA feels like they need to construct some bogus acronym to justify the name &ldquo;Messenger.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Acronyms are fine if they really help people remember and understand the program or product name. But in most cases, the acronym simply becomes a name and slowly loses all connection to the meaning.</p>
<p>And the worse case scenario is that you are so obsessed with creating an acronym, that you select a poor name in the process. Avoid creating acronyms just to be clever or just to justify a name choice.</p>
<p>Your best bet is always to give products, organizations and programs strong, appropriate names.</p>

<p>A little math problem for you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>One 15-minute PowerPoint<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> presentation has 5 slides. Another 15-minute PowerPoint presentation has 15 slides. Which presentation is shorter?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Obviously, both are 15-minute presentations. They are the same length.</p>
<p>But time and again, I talk to people who reduce the number of slides in their PowerPoint because they want to make the presentation ‚Äúshorter.‚Äù They think that if they have fewer slides, they will talk for a shorter amount of time. Often, they don‚Äôt take material out, as much as they condense it on the remaining slides.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>That‚Äôs completely the wrong way to think about it.</p>
<p>Next time you have a presentation, think about how long you have to present and build your story to fill the allotted time. Then create an appropriate number of slides to support your presentation. You may have more slides and move through them quickly. Or only a handful of slides.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But remember that the length of your presentation has almost nothing to do with how many slides you have.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I went to Subway last week. I don‚Äôt typically eat at Subway, but there is one by my office and I didn‚Äôt have much time for lunch. As I walked in, on the door, there was a window cling encouraging me to order soup with a combo. When I got in line, I looked up and there on the menu was an ad encouraging me to order soup. At the register there was another sign.</p>
<p>So I ordered soup.</p>
<p>I grabbed a seat. And realized I didn‚Äôt have a spoon. I looked up by the straws and napkins. There were forks and knives, but no spoons. So I asked the woman behind the counter ‚Äì the same woman who sold me the soup ‚Äì if they had any spoons. After asking another employee, she confirmed that they had no spoons in the restaurant.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-picture">The big picture</h3>
<p>It seems both silly and odd that a franchisee would go to all the trouble of putting up all the signs and ads and then mess up something as simple as having spoons.</p>
<p>But I think this type of thing is very common in business. Often, we see people obsess over seemingly insignificant details, only to completely overlook a major issue. They work on the details and lose sight of the big picture.</p>
<p>As designers, we see this a lot.</p>
<p>Clients spend time and energy critiquing minor elements of a design, but often forget to shore up the logistical issues that support a campaign. Marketing and design are critical, but so is customer service and support. Think about my Subway story for a second. The marketing worked. I entered the store. And I purchased soup. However because of a minor ‚Äì but critical ‚Äì oversight, I was a dissatisfied customer.</p>
<h3 id="social-media-and-a-lack-of-spoons">Social media and a lack of spoons</h3>
<p>Right now, social media is all the rage. Everyone seems to be talking about how social media can help their business. Worrying that they‚Äôll be left behind if they aren‚Äôt on Twitter or Facebook. Consultants are aggressively selling social media services.</p>
<p>But I fear many of these folks are losing sight of the big picture. Social media is a tactic. And yes, it can be an effective and powerful tactic. But as companies develop their social media plans, they cannot forget that it is just the beginning of the customer relationship. Strategically, you need to think through the entire customer experience. What are you going to do with your customers after you reach out to them through social media? How do you want to engage your customers on a continuing basis?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not saying social media is bad or that it isn‚Äôt important. There are absolutely uses for social media in business and marketing. Just remember that the social media tactics are only the beginning. You and your company need to prepare for a long-term customer relationship.</p>
<p>Or in other words, when you decide to sell soup, make sure you are ready to provide spoons.</p>

<p>One of the defining design characteristics of a ship in the Star Trek Universe is the forward viewscreen. And in the J.J. Abrams reboot of Star Trek, the entire concept of the viewscreen has also been reimagined.</p>
<p>By looking at how our vision of the future has evolved, we can often learn more about how we as a society have changed. And I think by looking at how the concept of the viewscreen has changed over the last four decades, I think we can draw some conclusions about how we have changed as culture and where we are going.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="the-original-viewscreen">The Original Viewscreen</h2>
<p>In Gene Roddenberry‚Äôs original Star Trek TV Show, the view screen was primarily a giant screen showing the outside. Very rarely, the screen would be used to show scientific data.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At the time, in the late 60‚Äôs, that concept was enough to seem futuristic. TV‚Äôs were still a relatively young technology. A screen that size providing live pictures with the ability to show content from the ship‚Äôs computer‚Ä¶ That was the future. Computers were room-sized devices with limited capabilities. The whole concept would have seemed very advanced.</p>
<p>The expectation was that interaction with a large viewscreen would be passive. It was something to watch, more like a TV than a computer interface.</p>
<h2 id="to-the-big-screen-and-back-to-the-small-screen">To the big screen and back to the small screen</h2>
<p>When the Star Trek series moved to the big screen in the late 70‚Äôs and into the 80‚Äôs, the viewscreen concept was only slightly refined. The expectation was still that the viewscreen provided a passive experience. Some odd touches were added, like a digital clock over the screen.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With the success of the movie franchise, Star Trek: The Next Generation launched into syndicated television. Because the series took place even further in the future, they took the established concepts and ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù the technology. The viewscreen evolved, but only from a technical level. The screen was now ‚Äúholographic.‚Äù (Note: I‚Äôm assuming this means the images were more realistic.)</p>
<p>The way the crew actually used and interacted with the screen was still passive and static. And through the three series that followed, the viewscreen never really did much more than provide pretty pictures.</p>
<h2 id="reimagining-the-viewscreen">Reimagining the Viewscreen</h2>
<p>When Abrams and crew started work on the reboot, they faced a challenge of honoring the style of the past and while projecting a modern, futuristic feel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had the weird challenge of having to take a 43 year old vision of the future and make it a current vision of the future. I wanted the movie to feel as tactile and tangible and as real as possible, but given what our computer interfaces are like now, its preposterous to assume that hundreds of years from now there won‚Äôt be some version of holographic screens and things that seem almost ubiquitous now in science fiction.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>-Abrams in an interview with Memory Alpha</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We as a culture have evolved to expect more from our ‚Äúviewscreens.‚Äù Many of our TV channels have crawls and information graphics. Look at what CNN produced during the elections or what ESPN News does on a daily basis. Our computers provide constant updates. Even our cars and phones have interactive interfaces. We expect modern screens to do more than just show us pictures. We expect them to inform us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That old concept of a passive viewscreen has been discarded in the new Star Trek movie. The giant viewscreen acts as a heads up display for the ship. Warnings, current speed, the health of the away team, status of the ship and more appear over the top of the screen. And the information that is provided is contextual, only appearing when needed or applicable.</p>
<h2 id="we-have-become-a-viewscreen-culture">We have become a viewscreen culture</h2>
<p>Looking at the new Star Trek viewscreen, it feels futuristic. And what that really means is that it feels like a radically advanced version of where we are now.</p>
<p>I think that we have become a viewscreen culture. We have become comfortable interacting with screens in a way that wasn‚Äôt comprehended in the late 60‚Äôs and wasn‚Äôt fully understood even in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. In fact, we are more than just comfortable. We now expect our screens to provide us information and feedback.</p>
<p>As the web, digital television, phones and computers evolve, our cultural expectations of the screens and surfaces around us with continue to change and evolve. We as designers are already starting to see this. People expect more from their web sites and other digital interfaces. They expect these tools to interact with them. To provide the information they need when they need it.</p>
<p>What designers need to remember is that this is just the beginning. People will continue to become more and more comfortable with screen-based content. And we must continue to push the limits of the medium to provide the interaction and capabilities that our society is beginning to expect.</p>
