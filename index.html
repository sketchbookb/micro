<p>I wrote a post in <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2016/11/09/twitterless.html">2016</a> asking how I would deal with the inevitable demise of Twitter. And followed up with posts in <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2018/01/03/twitterless-part-ii.html">2018</a>, <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/07/twitterless-part-iii.html">2022</a> and <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2023/07/25/twitterless-the-final.html">2023</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In each of the post, one common refrain kept resurfacing. There is no equal for following a live event on Twitter. The last month or so, there have been several events in tech and sports that I would have followed closely on Twitter.</p>
<p>You know what? I didn’t miss Twitter at all.</p>
<p>Instead, I stuck with Micro.Blog and Threads. On Micro.Blog, I follow not only other Micro.Blog users, but I also follow a number of Mastodon users who I previously followed on Twitter. Most of those people are journalists or experts who I do not know personally. On Threads, I follow mostly people that I know personally, many of whom have common interests. These two services combined provided everything I needed. I didn&rsquo;t even think about logging back into Twitter.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m baffled by friends who remain active on Twitter despite everything that Musk has said and done. They seem addicted to their “audience” and are scared to lose “engagement.” There are other options and it’s time to move on. The sooner you start building a new audience, the sooner you can leave Twitter.</p>

			 <p>I decided a while back that I wanted to separate my typeface designs onto their own site. They’ve always lived alongside my blog and other creative projects, but they needed a home of their own, especially since I plan to expand the offerings in the near future. I’ve been noodling around with options, but today, I’m finally ready to release <a href="https://www.sbbfonts.com">SbBFonts.com</a> out into the world with a design inspired by two-color printing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-inspiration">The Inspiration</h3>
<p>When I became a designer in the mid-1990s, the web was just becoming a thing, and printed documents were the primary job of a designer. Two-color projects used only two spot ink colors — say green and black — for the entire job. (You also had a “third” color with the paper, which was usually just white.) Four-color printing or full-color printing was reserved for only the most important pieces with the largest budgets. For young designers in a pre-web world, two-color work paid the bills. Two-color printing presented challenges, but the process had a particular look. Designers who knew what they were doing could use duotones for images or print on colored paper to get a different look.</p>
<p>Two-color printing isn’t dead. Screen printing and letterpress still use spot colors, but full color printing has gotten cheaper and as a society, we don’t print nearly as many marketing materials as we used to. The craft of designing has moved past the lowly two-color press run.</p>
<p>I guess that’s why when I started to design a home for my typeface designs, I knew I wanted the site to resemble a two-color print job. Much of the inspiration for my type designs comes from my nostalgia for old tech. Two-color printing seemed like the perfect inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="the-execution">The Execution</h3>
<p>The first question was what two &ldquo;ink&rdquo; colors to use? Since I wanted to use a dark background, I chose white and the bright green since I use that color for all of my Sketchbook B projects. I picked two dark greens to be backgrounds — essentially a dark mode and a darker mode.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Accommodating the two background colors meant that I also needed to use transparency on all of my example graphics, including my fake “duotones” and my animated GIFs. You can see the example below of one of the images I used placed over white, dark green and darker green backgrounds. I’m happy with the result, even if there are far easier ways to accomplish this look.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This site is hosted as a “single page” on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.Blog</a>. This might be the worst named feature on Micro.Blog since you can absolutely have more than one page. It’s simply a static Hugo site that doesn’t include a blog. I built everything on the <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog">Tiny theme by Matt Langford</a> — the same version that I use for <a href="https://www.bobwertz.com">bobwertz.com</a>. This feature is included in my Micro.Blog subscription, so my additional cost is essentially nothing.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>To get the look I wanted, I had to write a bunch of HTML and CSS. My old site was on Squarespace, so it has been a while since I worked so closely with markup. I spent a good bit of time digging through reference guides to make sure I was doing everything correctly. But honestly, if you look under the hood, it’s probably a mess. Just a warning.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I still have a little refinement left, but I’m happy with where the site is. I need to finish proofreading and rework some of the copy. I&rsquo;m thinking about future development&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got a plan on how to change the home page when I add a few more typefaces. Right now, I think the five fonts currently presented in this way is about the maximum.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://www.sbbfonts.com">SbB Fonts</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>The print designer in me would like to acknowledge that I’d likely need to use two hits of white on dark paper to get this effect. Meaning that it would likely need to be a three-color job.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I realized this morning that I’ve been using Fontstruct for 15 years. Fontstruct is an online tool for building modular typefaces. My first typeface design — Big Thursday — debuted on May 26, 2009. Since then, <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/154783/sketchbook_b">I’ve publicly released 49 fonts on Fontstruct</a> and 19 have been selected as “Staff Picks.”</p>
<p>The original version didn’t have a lot of flexibility,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but over time developer Rob Meek has added new brick types, construction methods, kerning, support for color fonts and other features to Fontstruct to make it more powerful. My work tends to be a little brutalist, but if you want to understand the flexibility of the tool, check out <a href="https://fontstruct.com/gallery?filters=staff-picks-only&amp;order=by-balanced-rating">the gallery</a> to see what amazing creations people can craft with this online tool.</p>
<p>I don’t use the most complicated features, but I sometimes use Fontstruct to prototype an idea for a new typeface. One of Fontstruct’s best integrations is that I can download a file that I can open and refine in Glyphs.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I recently created a design, moved it to Glyphs and built a variable font out of it.</p>
<p>Balancing work, family, grad school and other obligations, I don’t have a ton of time to spend in Fontstruct. But when they rolled out the Patron level of support for 5 euro a month, I subscribed immediately. I’m happy to support independent tools that are constantly improving.</p>
<p>I pulled together a sample of some of the designs I&rsquo;ve created over the years on Fontstruct. Feel free to <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/154783/sketchbook_b">head over to my page</a> and download anything you like. Or better yet, sign up for an account and start experimenting.</p>

			 <p>I started a blog in early 2008. Over the years, I wrote hundreds of posts and articles. Some of it good. Much of it forgettable. I authored a bunch of InDesign tips that generated search traffic, but over time, I became less interested in writing about Adobe Creative Cloud and design issues. A few years ago, I moved all my writing over to this site. As part of some work I’m doing this summer to clean up my various sites, <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/05/19/reading-back-over.html">I wanted to figure out how to save the posts from this old Squarespace site.</a></p>
<p>I tried to export the entire archive, but had limited success. The Squarespace export uses the Wordpress export format. And the export kinda works, but Squarespace’s software has inserted random code blocks throughout that would have to be removed manually. I thought about just shutting down the whole blog, but changed my mind. As I scanned over the list of articles, there were too many posts that I didn’t want to lose.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/05/19/reading-back-over.html">earlier post</a>, a friend of mine (who also happened to have an old Squarespace site) mentioned that he moved selected posts manually to a new site, and let go of the stuff he no longer focused on. The more I looked at my old writing, the more this seemed like the logical path forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that I’m going to slowly move selected posts to bobwertz.com. Several of them were written at a particular time, about specific events so I’ve decided to post them on the new site with the original date. I’ve added a sentence at the top, to explain that the post has been moved. I’ll make minor grammar or spelling corrections, but otherwise I plan to leave the posts as they are now.</p>
<p>As a test, I’ve moved two posts already: <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2015/05/14/bare-bad-acronyms.html">B.A.R.E. (Bad Acronyms aRe Everywhere)</a> from 2015 and <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2018/01/07/i-made-a.html">I made a red velvet cake</a> from 2018. I’ve got about 70 posts that I want to move, and I plan to move a couple of posts each week.</p>
<p>I think it’s worth noting that one of the reasons I feel comfortable moving everything to Micro.Blog is Manton’s commitment to ensuring the content you create can easily be moved, archived or backed up. I’ve turned on Micro.Blog’s Github backup feature, and I know I can export my content in a number of formats if I need to, including the <a href="https://indieweb.org/blog_archive_format">blog archive format</a> that Manton proposed. I wish more services realized the value of allowing easy export of content, and I’m appreciative of Micro.Blog’s commitment to portability and interoperability.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with this solution and even though it will take time to move the posts manually, I truly believe it&rsquo;s the best option for this situation.</p>

			 <p>A former coworker was arrested two years ago on a collection of shocking sexual assault charges, but at the time, there were few details. Now that court filings are beginning, our local paper has details and it&rsquo;s somehow worse than I thought. Nauseating. It&rsquo;s a strange feeling to have worked with someone 15 years ago and see them in the papers accused of truly horrific behavior. Were they that monstrous when we worked together? Probably. I&rsquo;m not going to link to the article because I read it and wished I hadn&rsquo;t. You don&rsquo;t want to read it either.</p>

			 <p>Several years ago, I moved all of my blog posting from my Squarespace-hosted sketchbookb.com to my Micro.Blog-hosted bobwertz.com. I’ve been happy with the move. My plan was to switch my Squarespace blog over to more professional posts, but that never really happened — and I don’t really feel like posting more InDesign and Creative Cloud tips. Last week, I decided that I need to do something with the old site and I’m working through my options.</p>
<p>One of the options was just to bring the site down and redirect sketchbookb.com to a new site. I’ve got over 600 posts, though, and while most of them don’t see any traffic, I’d hate to see them all disappear. I started to go back through the site to see what I’d lose.</p>
<p>My first post is in 2008 and my last post was at the end of 2021. There are many tips and tricks for InDesign that generate significant traffic even though they are very old. I also have a large number of reviews for iPhone apps that no longer exist. I wouldn’t miss those posts, but reading back through my writing, there is much that I do not want to part with. A reflection about being on a beach on a moonless night. My series of Twitterless posts and a handful of somewhat prescient rants about social media. My 52 Shirts project. New typeface introductions. Writing about our COVID reality. My original attempt at hosting my microblogging on Sketchbook B. My successful attempt to bake my mom’s red velvet cake recipe.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So what should I do? I’m not going to delete Sketchbook B without saving the posts somehow. I have first drafts of most of the writing in Ulysses, the app where I’ve done most of my writing for almost a decade.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But the final posts often have custom illustrations or additional copy edits, so the Ulysses version is somewhat incomplete. I’ve experimented with trying to export and move the posts from Squarespace, but that hasn’t gone well. One of my friends recommended saving the posts that matter to me and moving them manually to bobwertz.com. That would work for some of the posts, but it would be a tedious process. A couple of them — like my examination on viewscreens and interfaces in Star Trek — really could be updated. I may start updating and reposting select articles to bobwertz.com and just add a note to the beginning about when and where they were originally posted. We’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>I will still try to move them to another site. I have a full backup of my tweets, and I’d love to have Sketchbook B as well. The problem is that Squarespace exports using the Wordpress format, but they have some extra code in the export that causes problems.</p>
<p>Finally, the print designer part of me wants to pull together all the posts that matter and make a physical book. Place a copy on my bookshelf. It seems appropriate as a way to close an old chapter and start a new one.</p>

		<a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/04/30/what-value-does.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-04-30 07:18:16 -0400">Apr 30, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m noticing a tension growing between national organizations and their local affiliates. Just three recent examples that have crossed my path:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was once an AIGA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> chapter president and stepped down to go back to graduate school, but I was also <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/14/its-time-for.html">disillusioned with the mission and how the national organization treated its chapters.</a> Now AIGA National is struggling with finances and relevance, while member’s loyalty (and all the value of the membership) is tied up at the local level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Churches are going through the same thing. When the massive Methodist church near us left the denomination, they didn’t join one of the new organizations. They essentially became a non-denominational church. And pointed out in the news article that they get to keep all of the money they used to send to the churchwide organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organizers of the local NaNoWriMo<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> group in our area became frustrated with the national organization, and essentially became an independent writing support group. They were running a year-round organization anyway, and didn’t see the need for the national organization. Their Facebook group wiped all mention of NaNoWriMo</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>National organizations were once necessary to provide credibility, structure and support. Local organizations could provide local services and the relationship was mutually beneficial. Over time, that equation has shifted. Less value is provided by the national organization. Loyalties are with the local clubs, churches or groups. If the local leadership and the national leadership disagree, the local leadership has the leverage to take their organization independent. And in many cases, that seems like it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I do think there is value in national organizations, but organizations like AIGA need to better understand what value they bring to the table and strike a new balance with their local partners. Or risk becoming irrelevant.</p>

			 <h2 id="an-incredibly-strange-accident-but-my-wife-and-son-are-fine">An incredibly strange accident, but my wife and son are fine.</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Two weeks ago, Liz and Ryan were driving to school early in the morning in a midst of a rain storm when a pine tree blew into their path and impaled their 2020 Buick Envision. The tree was about 24 feet tall, passed through the headlight, through the engine, through the firewall, through the dashboard and extended several feet into the passenger cabin, between the front headrests.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By some miracle, Liz needed only four stitches on her hand, caused by a ring that had to be cut off her thumb. And my 12-year-old son, who was in the front passenger seat, was completely untouched. Numerous people from firefighters and policemen to tow truck drivers and insurance adjusters have said they’ve never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>After people processes the shock of the accident, and the relief that everyone is okay, most people look at the picture of the interior and have the same reaction: “Wait, why didn’t the airbags deploy?”</p>
<p>The airbags did not deploy. And <em>everyone</em> has a theory about why.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theory #1: The airbags didn’t deploy because they failed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The airbags should have deployed, but must have been defective. Most people who believe this want me to share a picture of the damage with Buick and complain. “They should have to compensate you” is a common refrain. &ldquo;You should sue.&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theory #2: The airbags didn’t deploy because the tree missed the sensors.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This theory was floated by the tow truck operator. Because the tree went through the headlight where there are no airbag sensors, the airbags didn’t deploy. In this scenario, the headlights are essentially a weakness in the car’s safety design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theory #3: The airbags worked as designed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> They should not have gone off because the accident wasn’t a typical head on collision. The car was immediately spun around in a lateral motion. The physics of the accident were weird and disorienting. It’s worth noting that my wife’s iPhone’s crash detection didn’t trigger either despite the fact that it was thrown to the floor from the center console. Several people have theorized that the force of the airbags could have made injuries worse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My gut reaction is that the airbags behaved as designed, but I also could understand if the car wasn’t engineered to withstand such a strange, one-in-a-million accident.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, though. I don’t know how airbag systems work. Most people don’t, but that hasn’t stopped us all from speculating. We imagine the airbag systems in modern cars to be this protective cloud that inflates around us, but I know it’s more complicated than that. We want to know why the airbags didn’t deploy because we want to be reassured that if it happens to us, we’ll be safe. But it’s just not that simple. There are too many variables.</p>
<p>We’ll never know why the airbags didn’t deploy, but Liz and Ryan are lucky to be alive and I’m incredibly thankful for that.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/04/22/buffy-the-vampire.html">Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Chocolate Cake for Breakfast, and Gill Sans: Separating work from their creator?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/04/22/buffy-the-vampire.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-04-22 22:00:41 -0400">Apr 22, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I watched a couple of my favorite episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer tonight. The show was once one of my favorites and creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> could do no wrong. I loved Buffy, Firefly, The Avengers and Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog. I even watched Agents of SHIELD. But eventually, it came to light that Joss wasn’t the feminist he claimed to be, repeatedly cheated on his wife, and verbally abused many of the people he worked with, especially Charisma Carpenter.</p>
<p>Chocolate Cake for Breakfast is one of my favorite stand up routines. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby">Bill Cosby’s</a> family-inspired standup — long before the Cosby Show — was hilarious. But later in life, he was credibly accused of drugging and sexually assaulting several women.</p>
<p>Gill Sans is a legendary typeface, created by author, artist and typographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill">Eric Gill</a>. I’ve worked for several companies for which Gill Sans was a key element of their corporate visual identity. But Eric Gill noted in his diary that he had numerous affairs, sexually assaulted two of his daughters&hellip; and his dog.</p>
<p>These are three examples, but they are far from the only examples. Many works of art and entertainment have been created by people who turn out to be despicable. How do you separate the creator from their work? Can you?</p>
<p>For me, I can separate Joss Whedon from Buffy and his other creations. He didn’t write every word and the show isn’t just him. The actors, writers, and staff brought the show to life and crafted the characters who I loved so much. But I have to admit that I’m now less likely to watch old episodes of Buffy, and I no longer hold the show on the pedestal that I once did.</p>
<p>It’s different for Bill Cosby and Eric Gill, though. Their creations are sole creative endeavors. As much as I might like Cosby’s old standup routines or Gill Sans, I can’t separate the creation from the person who created it. I don’t listen to old Cosby standup, and I don’t share it with my kids. I don’t use Gill Sans (or any Eric Gill typefaces) if I can avoid it. If I cite some of Eric Gill’s writings on typography like <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2024/03/30/inherent-indestructible-permanent.html">I did a couple of months ago</a>, I include a comment that he was a horrible human being.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’m not 100% sure this dichotomy makes sense, treating collaborative works differently than sole creations, but it’s where I am right now.</p>

			 <p>Almost 100 years ago, in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, typographer Eric Gill <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> wrote “An Essay on Typography” and addressed the tension between art and industrialization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But tho’ industrialism has now won an almost complete victory, the handicrafts are not killed, &amp; they cannot be quite killed because they meet an inherent, indestructible, permanent need in human nature.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been thinking about this as the internet fills with AI-generated garbage and popular social media sites are monetized by hate.</p>
<p><em>Inherent. Indestructible. Permanent.</em></p>
<p>While Eric Gill never imagined the internet, I think his statement applies just as much to our modern world as it did in the Industrial Revolution. Much of the internet might become cheaply-produced, AI-generated, SEO-approved content, but people all over the world who care about creativity and writing will still produce great work and share it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably being naive, but I’m still hopeful that the human need for creativity will overwhelm the capitalistic urge to industrialize content.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Almost 20 years ago, I was in San Francisco for my first AIGA Leadership Retreat. AIGA is a national organization for design<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and I was a first-time president for the South Carolina chapter. I’d just finished attending a session on leadership and one of my new friends who&rsquo;d been a president before pulled me aside and gave me some advice: “This is supposed to be fun. If it stops being fun, ask for help. You are giving up a bunch of your free time and if you aren’t having fun, it’s not worth it.”</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about that advice a lot lately and I’ve come to a realization. Our volunteer “opportunities” have become unpaid part-time jobs. (Maybe they always were…) We are saddled with job descriptions and expectations. We dedicate our time and energy to a cause because we believe in it, but we manage volunteer organizations following the only model we have: business.</p>
<p>I see it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->churches<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who are looking for people to fill roles and run programs to keep the organization functioning.</p>
<p>I see it in our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->professional organizations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, like AIGA, where we expect a level of excellence and professionalism on par with what we would expect from our corporate colleagues.</p>
<p>I see it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->academia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where professors do a massive amount of additional service work in reviewing journal submissions and organizing conferences.</p>
<p>I see it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recreational youth sports<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where people dedicate nights and weekends to coaching kids year-after-year.</p>
<p>I see it in our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->organizational boards<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are increasingly trying to recruit people with particular backgrounds and skill sets to provide professional guidance.</p>
<p>This problem is compounded by how we talk about these volunteer positions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are giving back, <em>not using your free time.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are offering your skills and abilities, <em>not providing free labor that other people would pay you for.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are providing service to the community, <em>not working for free.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We talk about this volunteer jobs more like a calling, not a job. And that makes it so much harder to separate from a position that is overwhelming.</p>
<p>The result of this structure is almost always burnout. Frustration. We often become stuck in our volunteer positions, unable to find someone to take over the incredibly complex structure or programming we have built or maintained. Unsurprisingly, most people — even if they care about deeply about an organization or cause — are unwilling to step up and commit massive time and energy to a cause when they are already juggling their own jobs and family commitments. The volunteer opportunity that you were excited about is now weighing you down and causing stress and anxiety. It’s no longer fun.</p>
<p>This situation isn’t good for the organizations either. After someone manages to escape from a volunteer position, how often does that person significantly decrease their involvement? I can’t tell you how many people I know who disappear after a long stint on a church council. Or how many former AIGA presidents I know who now have nothing to do with AIGA only a couple of years after their term is over. How many board members step away completely after their service is complete?</p>
<p>The mission of the organization then shifts from serving the community to finding the volunteers to sustain the organization.</p>
<p>We need to rethink volunteer leadership.</p>
<p><strong>The realignment starts at the top.</strong> If the leadership of an organization is overworked and burned out, the other volunteers will assume that’s normal. Some will try to emulate the behavior. Others will leave knowing they can’t commit that much. Our presidents, executive directors and other leadership need to model an appropriate work/life/volunteer balance. Working around the clock isn’t always the long-term, sustainable answer.</p>
<p><strong>We need to spend less time crafting our job descriptions and more time building relationships.</strong> We’re following the model we know, based on how our business organizations are structured, but I’m not sure that model works in today’s volunteer organization. While we need to make sure expectations are clear, we also need to worry less about the business-like hierarchy and spend more energy on engaging our community. Focus on doing good work, aligned with the mission of the organization.</p>
<p><strong>We need to be realistic about what we are asking people to do.</strong> Recruit more people to do smaller jobs instead of asking one person to commit a massive amount of time. Maybe in the past, you recruited one or two people to run an event. Maybe you should instead recruit 5-10 to cover the same amount of work. And if we can’t find the needed volunteers, it is time to scale back the project or event to be more reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>We need to be thankful for the contributions of others, no matter how small.</strong> Too often, we thank volunteers by presenting them with opportunities to embrace an ever-increasing volunteer workload. We need to actively discourage overcommitment… and never ask for more than anyone should rationally be able to give.</p>
<p><strong>We need to be thoughtful to fellow volunteers.</strong> It’s easy to get frustrated when people drop the ball. We need to check in on each other, be supportive and remember that we are all doing this for free, in our spare time, because we support the same cause and the same mission. We need to be understanding, not judgmental. We need to offer support, not criticism.</p>
<p><strong>Understand the difference between governance and micromanagement.</strong> Yes, we need boards to make sure that the money is being handled properly and the mission is well-defined. But the board shouldn’t micromanage everything. We need to let people do the tasks we ask them to do.</p>
<p><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Life can change in the blink of an eye. Be flexible with expectations. Be understanding when things don’t turn out the way you wanted. And realize that every volunteer is balancing life and work and family.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, we need to remember to have fun.</strong> These organizations and boards that we support, love and commit our time to… they should be enjoyable. And if they aren’t, it’s time to fix them.</p>

<p>Electric truck and SUV manufacturer <a href="https://rivian.com">Rivian</a> announced their new R2 SUV today, but surprised everyone with <a href="https://rivian.com/msp">a smaller R3 version as well.</a> I love smaller cars and I&rsquo;ve been waiting for new smaller EVs to hit the market, hopefully at a lower price point. The R3 looks adorable and it reminds me of a VW Rabbit, which I used to drive.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But Rivian didn&rsquo;t publish any specs so it&rsquo;s hard to gauge how big R3 is.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they provided high res imagery and it&rsquo;s easy to see the tire details — Pirelli Scorpion MS 235/55 R20. So based on a 20-inch rim size, and with a nice profile shot,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> it&rsquo;s possible to estimate the size with a little bit of simple math.</p>
<p>These numbers are rough, obviously. But here&rsquo;s what I got:</p>
<p><strong>Rivian 3</strong><br>
Length: 149 in.<br>
Height: 55 in.<br>
Wheelbase: 102 in.</p>
<p>That length looks a little short, but as you can tell from the picture, there is very little overhang in front or behind the wheels. For a point of reference, I compared those numbers with the specs of another EV model that I like a lot:</p>
<p><strong>2024 Hyundai IONIQ 5</strong><br>
Length: 182.5 in.<br>
Height: 63 in.<br>
Wheelbase: 118.1 in</p>
<p>The Rivian R3 looks to be a good bit smaller than the IONIQ 5 in all dimensions. In fact, the R3 looks closest to the size of a four-door gas-powered Mini Cooper:</p>
<p><strong>2024 Mini Cooper Four-Door</strong><br>
Length: 158.5 in.<br>
Height: 56.1 in.<br>
Wheelbase: 101.1 in</p>
<p>Of course, there are lots of caveats to this comparison. My numbers are rough, the car is a prototype, and things can change as the car moves to production. Who knows when it will be available to purchase, but I&rsquo;m excited about the Rivian R3. I&rsquo;m not in the market right now, but my next car purchase will be an EV. That size is actually perfect for what I want – a small EV to commute back and forth to work. Now we&rsquo;ll see where the price falls.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

			 <p>I used to dread calling my grandmother on her birthday. My mom died on that day and so every time I’d call, she’d start with “Well, you know, I wish Nancy was still here.” And that always bothered me and usually made me tear up, so I would wait as long as I could to call. I was pretty sure that I was the last grandkid to call each year.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago today, I called GiGi<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to wish her happy 89th birthday. She answered the phone upbeat and excited, telling me about all the people who had called her earlier in the day (including my siblings and all of my cousins, letting me know that I was, in fact, the last grandchild to call.) But she closed with a surprising statement, subtly mentioning that she “helped someone old today.” I was intrigued and asked for details.</p>
<p>GiGi was at the gas station filling up when she noticed an “old” man struggling to take the money up to the cashier. She took the money up for him and they struck up a conversation. The man was recovering from a double knee replacement. He was upset with his doctor that they&rsquo;d done both knees at the same time, and told him that “next time, we’re doing them one at a time.” The doctor told him “Mr. Jones. You are 99 years old. We aren’t doing another knee replacement.”</p>
<p>I tell that story often, but realized I’ve never written it down. I love how many lessons about attitudes, expectations and perspective are packed into one story. GiGi passed away a few years ago, living to the age of 98. Today would have been her 101st birthday. There are many stories to tell, but this is the story I tell about her most often and wanted to share it on her birthday.</p>

			 <p>March 3, many years ago, my mom died unexpectedly. In perhaps one of the greatest understatements ever, I struggled with her loss. Some days, I still struggle with her loss.</p>
<p>I discovered that on March 3, every year, I was grumpy. Kinda pissed off. And in general, not a fun person to be around. So I declared the day “International Bob is Grumpy Day.” Gave it a silly name. Explain to people how I&rsquo;m feeling. I told coworkers that it probably wasn’t the best day to ask me challenging questions. Or rely on me to be particularly tactful. In short, March 3 was the one day a year that it’s best to leave me alone. It worked. People left me alone, and I, predictably, was grumpy.</p>
<p>March 3 was also my grandmother&rsquo;s birthday. I&rsquo;d call her and she&rsquo;d mention how much she missed mom. And usually, I&rsquo;d tear up. Maybe the anticipation of the call was what made me grumpy. I don&rsquo;t know. Over time, I became less grumpy on March 3. Still sad, but I was able to understand the grief a little better. Decades heal. In my most recent job, my coworkers understood, but also didn’t let me sit in my office alone.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> They worked hard to keep my spirits up.</p>
<p>This year, I’ve decided that it’s time to retire International Bob is Grumpy Day. Instead of sulking, we are taking a day trip with the whole family — my oldest is home from college on Spring Break — and I’m going to enjoy the company of the people that I love. And take pictures. Because honestly, that’s the way mom would have wanted it.</p>

And while I think it’s probably the right call to end the program, I do understand why Apple tried.</p>
<p>Ten years ago when Apple started the project, it was the perfect moment to rethink the automobile. With the change to battery powered electric powertrains, many of the traditional constraints of car design were no longer relevant. You no longer need a motor, or a gas tank. Cars are more reliant on their technology stack. There were very few competitors and they were almost all selling cars at the high end of the market. It seemed like a perfect time for Apple to step into revolutionizing the design of cars, questioning the established conventions of the past. Changing how cars were designed, manufactured and sold.</p>
<p>And yet, today, that’s not what happened. In general, electric cars today look like gas-powered cars, but without the tailpipes. There are reasons for this, I think — consumer buying habits, aerodynamics and federal safety laws — but the result is that this isn’t the revolution that it looked like it might be. Couple that with the fact that the no-steering-wheel, self-driving tech that Apple was rumored to be pursuing is decades away from being truly reliable.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Battery advances are slow. When they started, there were few competitors, but that’s changed and lots of established car makers are committing to electric cars, with the addition of new upstarts like China’s BYD.</p>
<p>I understand why Apple started their car program. But after a decade of being stuck in neutral, I also understand why they finally ended it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>An established church in a small town has a simple sign by the side of the road. The town is growing and the road in front of the church is getting much busier. A new church down the road installs a large sign. Not wanting to fall behind the times, the established church installs a new sign, too. This sign allows the church to add custom messages to the sign by manually arranging letters.</p>
<p>At first, the church simply puts up their service times, but some people think that’s boring. The church needs more catchy information on their sign. Something that people driving by will engage with. The pastor recommends putting the sermon title on the sign, but after a few weeks, realizes that she’s got to come up with a catchy sermon title <em>every</em> single week. Someone volunteers to update it with a new bible verse each week, but they get tired of updating it and eventually stop. Another person finds a list of attention-grabbing church sign messages on the internet and volunteers to put those on the sign. But theologically, some of the quotes don&rsquo;t align with the church&rsquo;s teachings and others of them aren’t exactly welcoming. Some people driving by are offended by some of the messages. After a couple of years, everyone is sick of dealing with the sign, but the sign is very visible on the main road into town. The sign must be updated.</p>
<p>A handful of members decide to get together. They don’t exactly call themselves the “sign committee,” but they meet every so often to talk about the sign and what to put on it. After months of discussing the sign, they realize that the real problem is that they have to manually update the sign each week. Going out to the sign with those letters on cards takes time and a better solution would be to have a digital sign that could be updated remotely through the internet. As a bonus, one of these signs can cycle through multiple messages.</p>
<p>They raise the money and update their sign to have a beautiful glowing digital display. The sign is bright, but some people think it’s too bright. They start by including the service times each week. And bible verses. And sermon titles. And upcoming events. At first, lots of people are excited about the new sign and have lots of ideas, but over time, that excitement fades. Some people think the sign changes messages too quickly. While the sign is easier to update, keeping track of multiple messages, chasing down information, and updating the graphics takes more time than the old sign did. The sign becomes more than a weekly task. It’s a job. Sometimes, the sign glitches and a technician has to come fix it. Everyone is frustrated with the sign, but the money was spent and the sign is there. It needs to be updated.</p>
<p>Finally, the pastor decides that they are spending too much time dealing with the sign. She switches the sign to share a single message: “All are welcome.” Some people complain that the church isn’t using the sign to its fullest potential. But secretly, everyone is glad they don’t have to deal with it anymore.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve used a shorter version of this metaphor to talk about social media feeds that suck time and energy from an organization that doesn’t really need one (and usually doesn’t have the resources to support one). But I’ve been thinking that this parable/extended metaphor actually has a broader application. A couple of reflection questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many times do we take something on because we want what someone else has?</li>
<li>How often do we chase a new solution because it’s shiny and bright?</li>
<li>How often do you let the opinions of “some people” change how you feel about decisions?</li>
<li>What decision could you make that would simplify your life?</li>
<li>What have you built that you no longer need, but that you continue to spend significant time on?</li>
<li>When have you made a decision that turned out to be much more work than you planned? How did you handle it?</li>
<li>Has someone made a decision your secretly agree with? Why haven’t you told them?</li>
</ul>

			 <h2 id="a-new-look-and-branding-for-honda-evs">A new look and branding for Honda EVs</h2>
<p>Honda showed off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24030236/honda-zero-ev-global-series-concept-ces">two new EV concepts</a> under the new Honda Zero brand at CES — the Saloon and the Space-Hub. Most of the coverage is focused on the futuristic looks of the concept cars. As someone who grew up going to the Chicago Auto Show and seeing the cars of the future, I’d temper any expectations that the final designs will be this radical.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But as a branding researcher, what caught my attention is that they also rolled out <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a46339613/honda-new-logo-evs/">a new Honda “flying H” logo</a> to be used on all new electric cars. From the <a href="https://hondanews.com/en-US/electrification/releases/honda-debuts-new-global-honda-0-ev-series-with-two-new-concept-models">official Honda press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The current Honda “H mark” has a long history, dating back to 1981. In launching the next-generation EVs, Honda designed a new H mark, to express the company’s determination to undergo a historic transformation as well as the ability to constantly pursue new challenges and advancements. This new design expression, which symbolizes two outstretched hands, represents Honda’s commitment to expand the possibilities of mobility and continue to meet the needs of its customers. The new H mark will be applied on future Honda EV models, including the Honda 0 Series.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The logo simplifies Honda&rsquo;s current H, removing the outer bounding box and reshaping the mark. It does feel like a more modern mark and seems appropriate on the futuristic vehicles. As logo introductions go, this might be the slowest roll out in the history of visual branding since the first Honda Zero cars won’t be released until 2026. And since the logo is intended for <em>just</em> electric vehicles, that means that Honda is choosing to fragment their brand for a period of time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Honda Zero brand had its own mark at introduction. I&rsquo;d be surprised if this is used in marketing when the models debut in 2026. I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s going on here, since the elements don&rsquo;t really match anything.</p>
<p>Electric car branding is fascinating to me. VW and BMW add a letter or letters to the model number. Hyundai is using the Ioniq brand name for most, but not all of their EVs. Many vendors are rolling out EVs alongside their internal combustion engine lineup. VW is resurrecting the old Scout brand for a line of electric SUVs.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But to my knowledge, Honda is the first company to create a version of their corporate logo especially for electric vehicles. As the transition to electric vehicles continues, it will be interesting to see how EV branding continues to shift and evolve.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I adopt a theme each year and last year, the theme was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reset<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That theme included focusing on physical and mental health, writing more, getting organized and rediscovering creative endeavors. I made progress with three out of four goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote more, getting my first journal article published and I have several others in the works. I’ve written more here on Micro.Blog in 2023. So mission accomplished.</li>
<li>I did a good job getting organized, but I need to stay organized. There are still some areas I need to work on, but I feel like I made some progress.</li>
<li>I worked on a bunch of my typeface designs and even though I’m not ready to release anything, I feel like I was able to dedicate some time to visual projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>That leaves physical and mental health. I was particularly physically active for the first few months of the year, but hit a rough spot around April and lost momentum. I never got back in a rhythm.</p>
<h3 id="this-year-more-of-the-same">This year, more of the same</h3>
<p>As I started to plan for 2024, I felt like my focus was going to be solely on health. I felt great at the beginning of 2023 when I was more physically active, and I definitely want to get back to that level of activity. Combine that with processing the unexpected death of a coworker a few days ago — who was younger than I am — and I’m solidly committed to getting healthier in 2024.</p>
<p>But as I read over the list of my goals from last year, I still see room to improve in those areas, too. I’m still working on my Ph.D. and carving out time to write is critical. I still need to work on personal organization. And I need to work on creative projects — especially getting into a routine with my sketchbook.</p>
<p>So I go into 2024 with four goals&hellip; basically the same goals that I had last year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Get healthy.</strong> I’m not trying to run any races or achieve some incredible physical feat, but I do need to eat healthier and make time for physical activity. This is, without a doubt, my number one priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write more.</strong> Continue to write here, and work toward my Ph.D.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get organized and stay organized.</strong> Continue to refine and evolve my methods and tools for staying organized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explore creative endeavors.</strong> Keep working on typefaces, but also, get back into the habit of sketching regularly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve got a lot to be excited about in 2024, including my 25th wedding anniversary in August. I’m looking forward to a healthy and productive year.</p>

<p>I always pull together my favorite eight shots of the year (as a contrast to those algorithmically generated “Best Nine” posts). I love that it gives me an excuse to go back over all of my images from the last year and relive a lot of great memories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Our oldest decided to attend the University of South Carolina and had a great first semester.</li>
<li>Liz and I are notably bad a selfies, but this outtake was better than the actual selfie and I love it.</li>
<li>The girls were a little excited about seeing Taylor Swift in concert. (It was an amazing concert and I’m glad we all got to go.)</li>
<li>We have a high school graduate.</li>
<li>This is a big kitty yawn, but it looks so fierce.</li>
<li>Ryan is still playing lacrosse and bounced back after some adversity this summer to have a great rec season.</li>
<li>We attended my nephew&rsquo;s football playoff games. This was the final play in overtime that sent them to the state championship. They won that game, and won a state championship.</li>
<li>Birthday hike for my oldest included a stop at Looking Glass Falls in Pisgah National Forest. It was so cold, that the rocks were covered with ice.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the fifth year I’ve done a Favorite 8.

<p>Ryan&rsquo;s last two lacrosse games for this season were earlier today. He&rsquo;s been a goalie for a year-and-a-half now and he&rsquo;s gotten pretty good, expecially since he&rsquo;s just 11. It takes a special mentality to stand in there, shot after shot. If you notice in the image above, the ball is in the right side of the image flying toward him. Don&rsquo;t worry, he saved that one.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure he was going to play this season. He had a rough experience this summer, playing up two age levels against elite travel competition and it was a disaster. His confidence was obliterated and his body took a beating. His coaches admitted they were worried he was done after the experience. He put his stick in the corner when we got home from the last tournament and it stayed there, untouched, until about a week before the fall rec season. With the sign up deadline approaching, we talked and he decided to try again and see if he could get back in the groove. He really does enjoy playing and especially being part of a team. The result: He went 9-1 on the season and continued to get better and learn his position.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long he&rsquo;ll keep playing. He&rsquo;s looking forward to trying out for the JV team in a little over a year, so that&rsquo;s his next goal. But however long he decides to stick with it, I&rsquo;m immensely proud of his determination and resilience.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://bobwertz.com/2023/10/06/published-new-first.html">Milestone: My first published research paper is now online</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://bobwertz.com/2023/10/06/published-new-first.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-10-06 14:58:50 -0400">Oct 6, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve reached a big milestone in my academic career: my first published research paper.</p>
<p><em>Brand new: How visual context shapes initial response to logos and corporate visual identity systems</em> has bene published in the Journal of Product and Brand Management. It’s available now online and will  eventually be assigned to an issue. If you have access to journal articles through a university or public library, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPBM-08-2022-4124/full/html">you can access the article.</a></p>
<p>If you can’t access the article, here’s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a new logo is released, it does not have an established meaning in the mind of the viewer. As logos have become more highly scrutinized by consumers and critics, it has become more important to understand viewers’ initial response to logos. While other studies have researched the impact of aesthetic choices on viewer reaction to logos, this study aims to understand the effect of the surrounding visual identity system when a new logo is introduced. This study combines a content analysis of 335 posts on the logo review website <em>Brand New</em> with the voting data from their polls to understand how visual context correlates with a viewer’s initial response. Increased amounts of visual context correlate to an improved response from viewers. Different types of context that can be presented – from logo variations and environmental examples to videos and animation – have varied effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, my study finds that people respond better to new logos when they are shown more examples of the logo in use. This is one of those things that seems intuitive to designers, but hasn’t been researched or quantified. Because I’m a designer, most people are surprised that my research includes a fair amount of statistical analysis, but I’ve really taken to the quantitive side of things. This paper has been in review for over a year, working it’s way through the revision process.</p>
<p>It’s fitting that this is my first paper to be published. When I started grad school, I didn’t really know anything about scholarly research. In the spring of 2019 — my second semester as a grad student — I took a content analysis class with Carol Pardun. I was the only master’s level student in a class full of Ph.D. students. I felt so overwhelmed by the pressure to come up with an idea and learn methods and theories on the fly. The paper I wrote for that class was the first version of this paper. It was accepted to the AEJMC Conference that August and I presented in Toronto — my first academic conference presentation. I loved the concept for the study and got great feedback, but I was still learning and felt like I could improve it. I scrapped everything, started over with a larger sample and better methodology. After Dr. Pardun retired, I started working with Tara Mortensen on the next evolution of this work, which turned into my thesis. And that thesis eventually became this paper.</p>
<p>Thanks go out to so many people who’ve help me along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Pardun for supporting my bizarre little project, especially in the early days when the project was taking shape.</li>
<li>All of the Ph.D. students in that content analysis class who helped me figure things out and took me under their wing.</li>
<li>Dr. Mortensen for taking over as my thesis director and helping guide me through the publication process.</li>
<li>Kevin Hull and Van Kornegay for serving on my committee and providing helpful feedback.</li>
<li>Robert McKeever and Jacob Long for giving me an appropriate foundation for analyzing data.</li>
<li>Editor Cleopatra Veloutsou who guided me through the process with the <em>Journal of Product and Brand Management</em>.</li>
<li>All of the reviewers and discussants at the conference level for AEJMC and in the peer review process whose feedback legitimately made this paper better.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, this couldn’t have happened without the rest of Team Wertz. Liz and the kids have been so supportive and patient while I have embarked on this grad school journey. (And occasionally, Norah and Jill even joined me at Starbucks when I had to write.) I simply could not have done it without them.</p>
<p>I’ve still got a few years left until I finish my classwork and dissertation, but I’m exceptionally proud of this milestone and excited to see where my research goes next.</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow night, the Ahsoka finale airs on Disney+. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the show. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but I love Star Wars Rebels and it&rsquo;s great to see a continuation of the story line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a few absurd ideas about the finale that I figured I&rsquo;d share. Our heroes are on Peridea, in another galaxy. Thrawn is ready to come back to the core galaxy, partnered with the Nightsisters, to restore the Empire.</p>
<p>Here are 9 absurd things that <em>are not</em> going to happen on the season finale of Ahsoka:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Our heroes (and maybe villains) will remain stuck in the Peridea galaxy. That would at least explain where they were during the Rise of Skywalker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Force ghost Kanan Jarrus appears to&hellip; Ezra? Hera? Jacen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yoda&rsquo;s species is actually from this new galaxy, and they are the enemies of the Nightsisters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an even darker power in the new galaxy that is stronger than the Nightsisters and Thrawn&hellip; which is why they want to escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huyang helps Ezra make a new lightsaber, and the blade is&hellip; yellow or purple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All those New Republic ships are actually filled with Imperial technology and spies and Thrawn will be able to control them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Jedi temple on Peridea&hellip; with a portal that transports our heroes to Lothal via wolf ride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post credit scene features Hera assembling a team to fight Thrawn&hellip; including Zeb, the Mandalorian, Grogu, the surviving members of the Bad Batch and Rex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baylan Skoll actually does have a plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I warned you they were absurd, but the list was fun to come up with. Looking forward to seeing where the show lands. There is no way they can resolve all the various plot threads, so I assume there will be another season, or the storyline will be continued in another series. Eventually, we already know this leads to a new Dave Filoni-directed movie.</p>

After COVID shut everything down, several new coffee shops opened up including two very close to my house. I don&rsquo;t visit &ldquo;Grad School Starbucks&rdquo; very often these days, but it&rsquo;s funny how a space can hold so many memories&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently, we started rewatching Alias, the 2000s ABC spy thriller by J.J. Abrams.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> All five seasons are on Disney+ and we started from the beginning. Season 1 has 22 episodes, which was once considered a &ldquo;full season.&rdquo; Now, a streaming show rarely has more than 8 or 10 episodes a season.</p>
<p>Alias became a hit and attracted new viewers over the first season. But in the broadcast TV era, there wasn&rsquo;t an easy way for people to go back and watch the episodes they&rsquo;d missed. I remember ABC trying to rerun episodes as it gained popularity. And the &ldquo;previously on&rdquo; section got hilariously longer to try and catch people up.</p>
<p>The 17th episode of season 1, &ldquo;Q&amp;A,&rdquo; is an exposition-filled clip show where a skeptical FBI agent quizzes super spy Sydney Bristow (played by Jennifer Garner). She answers his questions, explaining the premise of the series while showing clips from previous episodes. Sydney basically tells the viewer everything they need to know in the lead up to the season finale. There&rsquo;s a reveal at the end of the episode&hellip; a revelation to keep the newly updated viewer hooked to come back next week.</p>
<p>As I watched it, I realized that this type of clip show episode — once a staple of 20+ episode network TV seasons — will likely fade from existence. Streaming services like Disney+ allow people to go back and watch the whole season easily. And shorter seasons mean that you don&rsquo;t need a budget-friendly recap episode. In today&rsquo;s streaming world, there is simply no longer a reason to make a clip show.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>We are in the midst of a huge shift in television. Most of the attention is directed at the financial aspects of the streaming era. The demise of the clip show episode is a comparatively minor shift, but it demonstrates how the changing financial model of the television industry directly shapes the creative product itself.</p>

			 <p>When the exodus from Twitter first started last year, many tech-savvy people were moving to Mastodon and <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/12/01/brands-federated.html">I wondered if brands would move their accounts to self hosted instances.</a> After all, from a branding standpoint, @offical@starbucks.com is better than @starbucks@mastodon.social. At the end of that post, I posited that someone would come along with a service that handled the fediverse complexity for companies.</p>
<p>That service is Threads.</p>
<p>Lots of people have asked why Meta was interested in providing ActivityPub support. I honestly think part of the story is so Meta can tell brands &ndash; their advertisers &ndash; that they can just publish on Threads and it will eventually be accessible on any other non-Twitter platform. Of course, they&rsquo;ve still got to deliver on that promise&hellip; right now Threads doesn&rsquo;t have ActivityPub support.</p>
<p>So far, branded accounts have flocked to Threads. If @BRAND-NAME@threads.com becomes the default for official branded social content, Meta benefits. I still think companies would be better off owning their instance with a branded domain, and maybe we will get there some day, but for now, it looks like Threads is where the brands are headed.</p>
<p>(I think that eventually, Meta will offer an upgraded &ldquo;brand tier&rdquo; that allows companies to use their own domain instead of <a href="http://threads.com">@threads.com</a>. for a substanial fee, of course.)</p>

<p>I’ve been preparing for the end of Twitter since 2016, when Twitter was struggling with some financial issues and the future was uncertain. I pondered what would happen of Twitter went away suddenly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2016/11/9/twitterless?rq=twitterless">2016: Twitterless:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which got me thinking, what if we woke up one morning and Twitter was gone. Or more likely, what if Twitter changed so radically, that it was unusable?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m more concerned that Twitter, or a company that buys Twitter, will change it so completely, that it becomes useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward a little over a year later. Twitter’s financial issues were less dire, but they were struggling with flat user growth, coupled with a rise in abuse and hate on the platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/3/twitterless-part-ii?rq=twitterless">2018: Twitterless, Part II:</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Twitter tries to jumpstart the service, I still believe the likelihood of Twitter imploding within the next few years is high.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Elon Musk bought Twitter, I assumed he’d shake things up, but I was concerned about the direction he would take Twitter in. I wrote a third Twitterless post to recap the changes that I’d made to deal with the hypothetical demise of Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/07/twitterless-part-iii.html">2022: Twitterless, Part III:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Twitter ceases to be enjoyable, I’ll leave. To be honest, I’ll miss it. I joined in 2008 and 14 years is a long time to use any service. It’s part of my daily routine. At the end of the day, though, if a service isn’t making my life better, I’m better off without it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once Twitter abruptly cut off third party clients, my Twitter usage dropped dramatically. I was a Twitteriffic user for over a decade, and it was obvious from the way he handled that situation that Elon Musk’s Twitter wasn’t going to be what I wanted. I moved on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, he’s changing the name of Twitter to X. I always assumed that someone would buy Twitter for the brand equity and change the service to make it more profitable. Instead, Musk changed the service <em>and</em> destroyed an iconic brand, all while making it <em>less</em> profitable.</p>
<p>I am going to miss Twitter. I’ve mostly enjoyed it over the years. I care enough about my own tweet history, that earlier this year, <a href="https://www.manton.org/2023/04/11/importing-tweets-to.html">when Manton offered a way to import all of my Twitter history,</a> I moved 15 years worth of tweets into <a href="https://bobwertz.com/tweets/">a searchable database hosted here on Micro.Blog.</a> I don’t know what I’ll use it for, but I do like having it.</p>
<p>I feel like I’ve prepared adequately for the Twitter apocalypse, but there is one area in particular where the loss of Twitter will still hurt. A common thread through all three Twitterless posts was a lament that there aren’t other services optimized for following breaking news or live events. This is still true. Maybe Threads,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Bluesky or Mastodon can step in, but until then, I’ll miss Twitter most when watching a sporting event, an Apple keynote or following a local news story. For the last few months, I’ve been viewing Twitter to check in during big events, but the time has come to move on.</p>
<p>Twitter is finally dead.</p>

			 <h3 id="new-social-media-outlets-prove-the-viability-of-indie-social">New social media outlets prove the viability of indie social.</h3>
<p>The invention of the printing press made mass media possible. Printing houses produced popular books and bibles, but they also spread the writing that powered the Reformation. Major newspapers became was the dominant media for decades, but there have always been community and independent newspapers. Self-publishing, indie music, art house films and college radio are all forms of independent media.</p>
<p>Economy of scale<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> pushes these systems toward consolidation. But as these media outlets consolidate into a few major players, there is always a market for an alternative. Why should social media be any different?</p>
<p>When the internet became popular, personal sites and blogs were the ultimate form of independent media. Economy of scale kicked in like it always does. Large news sites dominate and Google Search drives the traffic to the largest most well established sites.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Blogs became less popular, but there are still many independent blogs and personal sites around the internet.</p>
<p>With social media, consolidation drove us to a handful of sites. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok and Snapchat. The funding model drove this as well… Venture capital investment bet on the next big social media winner, and sites either made it big, or disappeared. (RIP: Path, Vine, Periscope, Gowalla, Google+, Google Wave.) I wasn’t sure there was space for independent social media.</p>
<p>All of the attention right now is on Meta’s Threads and the cage match with Twitter, but there’s a lot more going on in the space. Elon’s purchase and erosion of Twitter<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> has opened the doors to alternatives. ActivityPub is starting to take root that will allow some interoperability between sites. I’ve been a Micro.Blog subscriber for years and it’s a wonderful independent social space.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Mastodon and Bluesky are both putting forward their visions for an open web. And users are adapting Discord and other sites to create smaller, independent communities.</p>
<p>These sites now have a large enough user base to stick around, and technical solutions like ActivityPub allow easy access to creators on other networks. The businesses aren’t (currently) poisoned by the venture capital desire to grow fast and get rich. This is how a healthy independent social media ecosystem develops.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each iron-air battery is about the size of a washer/dryer set and holds 50 iron-air cells, which are then surrounded by an electrolyte (similar to the Duracell in your TV remote). Using a principle called “reverse rusting,” the cells “breathe” in air, which transforms the iron into iron oxide (aka rust) and produces energy. To charge it back up, a current reverses the oxidation and turns the cells back into iron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Reverse rusting?&rdquo; Weird. Interesting implications for power grid management, though.</p>

<p>On a Mac, it’s easy to share the original URL. Click the share button in the upper right hand corner of the interface, and choose Safari. It opens the original article on the web and you can then share that URL instead of a link to Apple News.</p>
<p>On the iPhone, it’s not as simple. Click the ellipses in the upper right and select Share Story. Then from the list of apps that appears, select Safari. (You may need to click More and scroll down to find it.) The result is the same as the Mac, a new Safari window with the original URL.</p>

			 <p>So there are lots of rough edges on Threads, and it&rsquo;s owned by Meta, which is problematic. But their killer feature is audience. I&rsquo;ve been in for about 12 hours and I see lots of people I know. Will they stay? No idea. But it&rsquo;s off to a solid start.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://bobwertz.com/2023/07/04/the-instagram-threads.html">The Instagram Threads launch and media effects theory</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2023/07/03/three-questions-ahead.html">I mentioned I was interested in the media narrative</a> surrounding the introduction of Instagram Threads. I wanted to expand on what I’m looking for, and to do that, I need to start with some mass communications theory.</p>
<p>I’m a Ph.D. student that mostly researches visual effects, but I’ve taken a few classes that look at how media effects work. There are levels to media effects, but essentially, you can break it into three types of effects.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agenda Setting</strong> tells you what to think about.</li>
<li><strong>Framing</strong> tells you how to think about it.</li>
<li><strong>Priming</strong> prompts you to take an action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone teaches this a little differently, but this is how I like to think about it. As I look at how the media covers Instagram’s Thread, I think it’s worth thinking about the coverage in these terms.</p>
<h3 id="agenda-setting">Agenda Setting</h3>
<p>The media is very good and setting the “agenda” for what people are thinking about. If the media you watch or read is covering a topic, you are more likely to care about the topic.</p>
<p>We know that the tech media like The Verge have picked up the thread and predictably, tech circles online are discussing what Instagram Threads will mean for social media and the Fediverse. This is agenda setting in action.</p>
<p>But will the <em>mass</em> media cover it? Will the CNN website run a story about Instagram Threads? Will The NY Times run an explainer about how to use Threads? Will South-Carolina-native and all-around good guy Craig Melvin talk about Threads on the Today Show? I don’t know.</p>
<p>While “agenda setting” sounds a little nefarious, it isn’t always. There are many factors that go into story selection. One major challenge right now is the crowded media environment. Take a look at the front pages of major news websites and what do you see? Supreme Court rulings. Mass shootings. Russia’s mutiny. Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Trump’s indictments. Protests in France. The U.S. relationship with China. Interest rates. Inflation. These topics all compete for space and time in a news organization. Does the introduction of a new service from Meta really rank up there in importance with these other topics?</p>
<p>News media also pay attention to metrics about their readership. If viewers are reading stories about Threads, editors will assign more stories. If people aren’t interested in the topic, it will fade. There seems to be general interest in the Elon Musk’s mismanagement of Twitter and his rivalry with Mark Zuckerberg. If people are reading the stories about Threads, maybe Meta does get a little more coverage than something like this would normally merit.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Honestly, I’ll know if there is mass media coverage when my wife asks me what I think about it.</p>
<h3 id="framing">Framing</h3>
<p>The next level relates to how the stories are positioned. We know that tech media is framing the release of Instagram Threads as the latest change in a rapidly changing social media world. The stories right now seem to be largely framed as a contrast with existing Twitter alternatives, especially given the conversations within Mastodon admins about whether to preemptively block access to a service that may support ActivityPub.</p>
<p>But for a mass media audience, that’s all too nuanced. Given the high profile implosion of Twitter, and the bravado between Musk and Zuckerberg, I think pretty much every story is going to frame Instagram Threads as a Twitter-killer.
I do imagine that they’ll at least mention Mastodon and Bluesky. Beyond that, who knows.</p>
<h3 id="priming">Priming</h3>
<p>If the mass media covers the introduction of Threads – and the framing is positive – the coverage may be enough to prompt people to sign up for accounts. This priming effect is typically short-lived, but if Meta is able to get a lot of news coverage, there may be a surge in sign ups not too dissimilar to the surge in interest surrounding Mastodon and Bluesky. This won’t necessarily translate into engaged customers, but getting people to download the app and try the service is the first hurdle for Meta.</p>
<hr>
<p>So as you look at the media coverage surrounding the launch of Instagram Threads, think about it in terms of agenda setting, framing and priming. (And actually, as you look at media bias in general, these three concepts are helpful in understanding how it works and why it happens.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You could argue, I suppose, that this is just the natural end of a specific part of the internet. We spent the last two decades answering a question — what would happen if you put everyone on the planet into a room and let them all talk to each other? — and now we’re moving onto the next one. It might be better this way. But the way it has all changed, and the speed with which it has happened, has left an everybody-sized hole in the internet.</p>

			 <p>I looks like Meta will release their text-based, Instagram-branded Twitter competitor this week. Am I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->excited<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/3/23783227/meta-instagram-threads-twitter-competitor-app-store">Instagram Threads</a>? Not really. I&rsquo;m happy with the current state of my social media usage.</p>
<p>Am I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->curious<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about it? Absolutely. We are in a fascinating period of change in the services we use online and the ways we share information. Specifically, I&rsquo;m interested in three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Will Instagram users actually adopt it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This is the big question. Will the people I follow on Instagram start accounts? And will they post content that I&rsquo;m interested in? What will the demographics of the user base be? So many question about what this audience might look like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How will the ActivityPub implementation work?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> As a devoted Micro.Blog user, I&rsquo;m interested in the rumored ActivityPub integration. Will I be able to follow Threads users on Micro.Blog? Can I cross post from Micro.Blog? As the first mainstream ActivityPub implementation, it will be interesting to see how they connect with the larger Fediverse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What&rsquo;s the media narrative?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It&rsquo;s guaranteed that there will be a direct contrast with the dumpster fire that Twitter has become, but what other media narratives will take shape. How will it be compared to Mastodon and Bluesky? Will media coverage increase consumer knowledge about the ActivityPub? Sounds like a research paper for grad school.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably sign up for an account, since Instagram is pretty much the only social media I use other than Micro.Blog. And we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been to a lot of high school graduations over the years. And most of them aren&rsquo;t great. They start late. The guest speakers and district officials give speeches that aren&rsquo;t particularly inspirational. The student speakers share a bunch of inside jokes that make sense to a small slice of the graduating class. And they just last too long.</p>
<p>So while I was looking forward to my daughter&rsquo;s graduation today, I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to the ceremony itself. (Not to mention the ceremony was held at 8 a.m. on a Wednesday morning.)</p>
<p>What I got instead was a delightful ceremony. It started right at 8:00. The student speakers did a wonderful job. They incorporated some meaningful traditions. The district superintendent delivered short and relevant remarks. The whole thing was done in 1.5 hours with around 350 students graduating. Everyone had their name read and crossed the stage. My daughter was happy and I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

			 <p>Our neighbors installed a new security system a couple of weeks ago. When you walk anywhere near it &ndash; and that radius includes <em>our</em> driveway &ndash; a recording plays: &ldquo;You are currently being recorded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have great neighbors, but when I first heard it, I was a little annoyed. My wife was irritated, too. Every time we walked to our cars&hellip; &ldquo;You are currently being recorded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days after this started, I was walking out to the car with my kids and the alarm system informed us that we were being recorded&hellip; and my 15-year-old daughter waived in the general direction of the camera, yelled &ldquo;Hello camera&rdquo; and got in the car. She repeats this greeting every day when she leaves for school, choosing to be amused instead of irritated.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There are two lessons in this story:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t install a talking alarm system. It&rsquo;s annoying. (My neighbor isn&rsquo;t happy either. He says it is way too sensitive and goes off at the slightest movement.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can choose to be amused instead of irritated. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s best to greet the metaphorical camera and go on with your day.</p>

			 <h2 id="not-everything-is-going-to-change-the-world-tomorrow">Not everything is going to change the world tomorrow</h2>
<p>I’m not sure when the “hot take” era started. It predates the internet<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but social media really seems to have kicked it into the stratosphere. There’s a rush to hype everything as the next disruptive invention. Wearable devices. Foldable displays. Ride sharing and self-driving cars. Blockchain and cryptocurrency. Artificial intelligence and machine learning. AR and VR. Federated social media.</p>
<p>While social media drives the hype train, it’s powered by money. Major companies are afraid of missing a big trend and becoming irrelevant. Small companies see an opportunity to move fast and take advantage of the new tech. VC firms are willing to gamble on the technology in hopes of a big pay day. Entrepreneurs sell grand visions with hopes of making it big. All of these entities benefit from building the hype around every new technology.</p>
<p>What technology really needs is time to mature. Time to work the bugs out. To discover the downsides and figure out how to address them. To build a sustainable business model. Instead, too often, the money-powered hype train moves too fast and the whole thing just derails.</p>
<p>I love reading about technology and learning about all the latest advancements, but I’ve been following technology long enough to know that slow and steady usually wins the race.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <h2 id="whats-in-hanger-bay-12">What’s in Hanger Bay 12?</h2>
<p><strong>WARNING: Spoilers and speculation about Star Trek: Picard.</strong></p>
<p>In Star Trek Picard season 3, episode 6, <em>The Bounty</em>, the USS Titan jumps to the Starfleet Ship Museum to get help from Commodore Geordi La Forge. The first exterior shot of the museum includes a selection of familiar ships (like the Enterprise A, Voyager and the Defiant) positioned in rings around the exterior of the space dock. There was one empty ring, and so the Titan &ldquo;hides&rdquo; in plain sight among the museum ships.</p>
<p>When Geordi and his daughter Alandra beam aboard the Titan, they reveal that the Titan and all modern Federation ships are networked with each other. Starfleet will find them. Picard is pleading with Geordi to help when his daughter interrupts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alandra (quietly): “Dad. What about Hanger Bay 12?”<br>
Geordi (exasperated): “Alandra. Please.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the dialog continues. I assumed that what was in Hanger Bay 12 would be the key to the episode, but it’s not. Jack Crusher steals the cloaking device from Star Trek IV&rsquo;s Klingon Bird of Prey and the Titan rushes off to rescue Raffi, Riker and Worf on Daystrom Station. Hanger Bay 12 is never mentioned again.</p>
<p>So, what’s in Hanger Bay 12? Likely a new ship for the museum that was intended for that empty circle that the Titan parked in. Alandra clearly thinks the ship would be helpful — maybe because it’s not networked. I assume that the ship in Hanger Bay 12 was likely intended to be unveiled as part of the Frontier Day ceremony and then intended to fill the empty ring at the Fleet Museum. Instead, I imagine that Picard and crew are going to come riding to the rescue in that ship&hellip;</p>
<p>My guess: The Enterprise 1701-D.</p>
<p>I can’t think of any other ships that are significant enough and aren’t already represented in fleet museum. The 1701-D was destroyed in <em>Star Trek: Generations</em>, though. How could it reappear? Well, at least one of the ships they show in the museum, The Enterprise 1801-A, is a replica since the original was destroyed in <em>Star Trek III</em>. The new Enterprise-D could simply be a retrofitted Galaxy-class starship. Or the original 1701-D saucer section paired with a different Galaxy-class body.</p>
<p>It might seem like excessive fan-service, but if done well, I think it would be incredible to see the crew save the day in the ship from the TV show. Picard, Riker and Troi in the three command seats. Worf at tactical. Data at helm. Geordi in engineering. It would be a fun conclusion to this final season of Star Trek Picard.</p>

			 <h2 id="the-beta-service-gives-some-insight-into-how-adobe-views-ais-role-in-the-creative-process">The beta service gives some insight into how Adobe views AI&rsquo;s role in the creative process.</h2>
<p>I recently got access to <a href="https://firefly.adobe.com">Adobe Firefly</a>, a beta generative AI system. It’s not a surprise at all that Adobe is experimenting with generative creative tools. Adobe is clearly looking at ways AI can integrate with the tools that they already offer. Thankfully, unlike an earlier wave of visual AI tools, Adobe has trained their AI model on properly-licensed images. Generated images are restricted to non-commercial use and a label is added to exported images, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23587393/ai-art-copyright-lawsuit-getty-images-stable-diffusion">you shouldn’t see a Getty Images watermark anywhere.</a></p>
<p>I’ve been following news about generative AI, but I haven’t really experimented with any of the other tools. It’s been more of an abstract curiosity. Now after playing with Adobe Firefly, I can see some of the practical implications of generative AI tools and started to think about how those features could fit into a design workflow. Also, as a Ph.D. student trying to settle on a dissertation topic, I see lots of research questions when I look at generative AI and Adobe Firefly.</p>
<p>Right now, the service has two features: Text to Image and Text Effects. I’ve spent a little bit of time experimenting with Adobe Firefly and wanted to share some initial impressions.</p>
<h3 id="text-to-image">Text to image</h3>
<p>The text to image feature is straightforward. Type in a prompt and Firefly generates four images. On the right, there is a palette with options that lets you refine your request. You can choose the aspect ratio, content type, style, lighting and composition. Below is a screenshot of the interface and a few examples of what it can do:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prompt:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> green metal fish-shaped spaceship on an alien planet<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Styles:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> art, concept art, dramatic light, flat colors</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prompt: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->green hot rod racing through the desert<br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A couple of quick reflections on using Firefly’s Text to Image feature:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="text-effects">Text Effects</h3>
<p>Text Effects lets you specify and apply an AI-generated effect to some text. Firefly has a few sample effects that give you a good idea of what the feature can do. You can choose from 12 different fonts.</p>

<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Adobe Firefly is definitely a work in progress – it is a beta – but there are more features in development. The Adobe Firefly site lists one feature as coming soon, Recolor Vectors. I’m not sure how that will differ from the Recolor Artwork feature in Adobe Illustrator, but I’m looking forward to trying it out. Several other features are teased as “In exploration” and some of them look interesting. No idea how close to release these are — for all I know, they are ideas on a white board — but “text to vector” and “extend background” could be fun to play with. I’ll likely write additional posts as new features are introduced.</p>

			 <h2 id="customize-your-navigation-with-filtered-categories">Customize your navigation with filtered categories</h2>
<p>When I first moved my blogging over to Micro.Blog, I struggled with the perceived rigidity of the navigation. It took me a little time to refine it, but I eventually figured it out. I’ve had a couple of people ask about my solution, so I figured I’d share a quick summary of how I set it up my navigation.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t matter what theme you are using, but for my site, I use the <a href="https://github.com/chrishannah/Pure">Pure plug in</a>, which is a good foundation to build from. By default, the template presents a home page that includes all of your posts. Instead, I wanted to have different links in my navigation for my longer “blog” posts and my shorter “tweet-like” status posts.</p>
<p>It’s actually pretty easy to do, but it takes a few steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Create the categories you want.</strong> I created two categories: Quick Updates and Long Posts. You can create as many categories or group them differently, but this worked for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set up filters.</strong> Filters will automatically apply categories based on different parameters. Click the “Edit Filters” button beneath the list of categories. I set up two filters. One that sorted untitled posts into my “Quick Thoughts” category and a second that grouped together all of my long posts with titles. This way, my posts are automatically grouped into one of the two categories. In the screenshot below, I used the &ldquo;Post Length&rdquo; setting.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine the URL for each category.</strong> Each category in Micro.Blog has a URL, typically formatted as <code>http://DOMAIN-NAME/categories/CATEGORY-NAME.</code> Find the URLs for each of the categories you want in the navigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a new page.</strong> Name the page and then paste the category URL into the content box.  Make sure “Include this page in your blog navigation” is checked. Repeat for all of your categories. You’ll then have a navigation item for each of your categories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This technique works really well when paired with the Custom Home Page plug in. You can see the result in the navigation <a href="http://www.bobwertz.com">on my site.</a> I know that I could do this by building a custom template. At some point, maybe I will. But right now, I&rsquo;d like to keep it as simple as I can, and this works really well for me.</p>

			 <h2 id="solid-progress">Solid progress</h2>
<p>One of my goals for this year is being healthier. Eating better. Moving more. The hope was that by breaking some bad habits I developed during COVID, I could lose some weight and feel better. I wanted to post occasional updates to keep myself accountable.</p>
<p>Two months in, things are going great. I feel significantly better — that’s the “metric” I care about most — and I’ve dropped a significant amount of weight. I’m not doing any trendy diet or counting calories. I’ve adapted some principles from intuitive eating.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I’m making smarter decisions about food and listening to my body. One example, I’ve pretty much stopped drinking beverages with calories. At Starbucks, I get a black coffee or hot tea. Unsweetened tea instead of sweet tea.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I’m not drinking sodas. I’ve generally avoided alcoholic drinks, but had a glass of bourbon at our Valentine’s Dinner. My energy level feels more consistent through the day without the sugary sodas and extra caffeine. And I’m sleeping better. Wins all around.</p>
<p>Exercise wise, I’m just focused on movement.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> I’m walking regularly. My wife and I have started taking long walks on the weekends, exploring the trails that are literally <a href="https://www.icrc.net/parks/mungo-park"><em>in our backyard.</em></a> I’m trying to walk at lunch and walk to meetings around campus. I’m not running on a treadmill — or running at all. I might get to that point, but that’s down the road.</p>
<p>I do want to address the tech side of this. I purchased a <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus">Withings Body+</a> scale, and it syncs my weight to my Apple Health account. I use <a href="https://happyscale.com">Happy Scale</a> to track weight because it does a nice job of showing averages instead of just focusing on the lowest weigh in. I’m tracking activity and workouts with Apple Watch. I tend to be a data person, and I like having all these metrics. I just need to make sure I’m not fixated on the metrics. Again, the main goal is feeling better and developing healthy habits.</p>
<p>Two months in, I feel like I’m heading in the right direction. I’m making long-term lifestyle changes, and I know this is just a start. I plan to check back in here every month or so with an update.</p>

<h3 id="ensign-sylvia-tillyhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikisylvia_tilly"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvia_Tilly">Ensign Sylvia Tilly</a></h3>
<p><em>Played by Mary Wiseman on Star Trek: Discovery.</em> When Star Trek first relaunched with Discovery, Tilly was such a different type of crew member. For all of the great Star Trek characters over the years, very few were quirky <em>and</em> likable.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Her relationships with Burnham, Stamets and Saru are wonderful. I wasn’t happy how they used her over the last season — eventually shipping her off to Starfleet Academy — but I hope next season includes a healthy dose of Tilly.</p>
<h3 id="rok-tahkhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikirok-tahk"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rok-Tahk">Rok-Tahk</a></h3>
<p><em>Voiced by Rylee Alazraqui on Star Trek: Prodigy.</em> If you haven’t seen Prodigy, you&rsquo;re missing out. Rok-Tahk is my favorite character from the crew. At first, Rok appears to be a fierce creature, but once the universal translator kicks in, you figure out that despite her intimidating form, she’s actually just a young girl with an interest in science. Her relationship with the Janeway hologram was encouraging and nurturing and I loved every minute of it. I look forward to seeing how she interacts with Admiral Janeway next season.</p>
<h3 id="christine-chapelhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikichristine_chapel"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Christine_Chapel">Christine Chapel</a></h3>
<p><em>Jes Bush on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.</em> I know Nurse Chapel appears in the Original Series and a couple of movies, but Jes Bush’s interpretation of the character is so different and distinctive. Chapel is incredibly smart and capable. And yes, she has a crush on Spock, but their relationship is much more nuanced and complex. We know where this character is heading, but I look forward to seeing how this version of Chapel develops.</p>
<h3 id="ensign-beckett-marinerhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikibeckett_mariner"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Beckett_Mariner">Ensign Beckett Mariner</a></h3>
<p><em>Voiced by Tawny Newsome on Star Trek: Lower Decks.</em> Lower Decks has so many great characters, but Mariner is my favorite. She’s a screw up, who also happens to be incredibly capable when she wants to be. Her relationship with her friends, her rivals and her mom are all complex and delightful. Depending on the episode, Beckett may create a massive problem — or she could be the one to save the day. The end of last season was heartbreaking when her mom and friends thought she’d sold out the Cerritos crew. Many of the relationships were patched up in the finale, but I wonder if there will be lasting repercussions.</p>
<h3 id="captain-saruhttpsmemory-alphafandomcomwikisaru"><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Saru">Captain Saru</a></h3>
<p><em>Doug Jones on Star Trek: Discovery.</em> Look, I know Captain Michael Burham is the star of the show, but Saru is the captain I’d want to serve under. Intelligent, thoughtful and competent. His personal backstory is wonderful, and I’m really interested to see his relationship with the leader of Vulcan develop. I’m not sure how Doug Jones can express so much emotion through all of that makeup. It’s seriously impressive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, while it&rsquo;s not a character, I want to give a shoutout to Lower Deck’s California class ships, especially the U.S.S. Cerritos. The idea that there are some <em>average</em> ships in the fleet is great. Other Star Trek shows focus on the glamorous flagship, but not every ship is the U.S.S. Enterprise.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Well&hellip; Five new and one reimagined.</li>
<li>You could argue that Barclay was quirky, but he was intentionally annoying. Neelix was intended to be quirky, but he was really just creepy.</li>

			 <p>I decided to add a <a href="/now">now page</a> to my site. My challenge was deciding what to include on the page. I already had a pretty complete <a href="/about-bob">about</a> page. After looking at <a href="https://nownownow.com">a collection of now pages</a>, I realized that there isn&rsquo;t a single formula or approach. So for my first attempt, here&rsquo;s what I decided to add.</p>
<ul>
<li>What I&rsquo;m working on</li>
<li>Recently written</li>
<li>Recent media favorites</li>
<li>Active websites and profiles</li>
<li>Social media accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>I also moved the status of the fish in the header to this page. The fish changes from time to time based on my mood so that explanation makes more sense on my &ldquo;now&rdquo; page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my approach will change over time. Everything needs to be manually updated and I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll update every month or so.</p>

			 <p>I missed Twitter today during the South Carolina/UConn women&rsquo;s basketball game so I went over to Twitter to check out the chatter. (Gamecock &lsquo;Fams&rsquo; are notoriously active on Twitter during games.) Instead, Twitter kept serving up tweets from yesterday&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s game&hellip; almost a day old. Eventually I gave up. It&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<p>Big win on the road, though. #1 South Carolina came from behind to beat #5 UConn. 🏀</p>

			 <p>I feel like I always write things that are either &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; length or &ldquo;long.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t feel like I ever post anything in between. This tendency isn&rsquo;t new&hellip; I&rsquo;ve always written that way and I&rsquo;m not sure why. Most of my favorite online writers routinely share posts of various lengths, but I&rsquo;ve never changed my approach. As I try to get back in the rhythm of writing, I think I need to embrace the middle ground. Opting to post reflections more than complete essays. Questions instead of answers. Paragraphs instead of pages. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>

			 <h2 id="maybe-its-time-for-something-different">Maybe it’s time for something different.</h2>
<p>For years, I listened to local sports talk radio on my commute home. I live in the middle of SEC country, and — especially during football season — the talk shows were full of callers who were mostly annoying and overly opinionated.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  The host of the show was great and I really enjoyed his commentary, so I kept listening. One day, after a particularly obnoxious sequence of callers, I tweeted something like “I’d love a sports talk show without callers” and tagged him. He responded, thanked me for listening, but said that most people didn’t want to listen to him talk for a couple of hours. They tuned in for the callers. That was the format.</p>
<p>Audience commentary is part of every type of media. With newspapers, we’ve long had editorial pages, op-eds and letters to the editor. Radio has a whole sub-genre of talk radio that features callers giving their opinions and arguing with hosts. Television never really developed a feedback format because of obvious technical limitations, but developed something similar. Panel discussion shows are basically talk radio with a standard roster of characters, arguing with each other and representing viewer opinions.</p>
<p>The internet made commentary even easier. In the early days of the web, every news site and blog added comments to their stories to encourage feedback. The feedback quickly turned to meaningless noise, filled with extreme opinions and spam. Social media took it one step further. Facebook and Twitter are essentially <em>just</em> the comments section. Commentary <em>became</em> the media.</p>
<p>Some people love to read the letters to the editor and listen to talk radio. Many people — judging by ratings — watch television shows with a panel of guests arguing with each other about news or sports. There are people want to read the comments on news sites, although I don’t understand why anyone would subject themselves to that. And there are people who truly enjoy social media. This is all commentary-driven media.</p>
<p>I’ve realized that I don’t like any of those things.</p>
<p>I like to read articles that provoke thought. I visit news sites and blogs that cover my (many) areas of interest. I use an RSS reader to track all of these sites. I follow photographers, videographers and creators who make original art. I listen to podcasts that add value and knowledge. I follow people on social media who are experts in their field, but I rarely respond or comment on their posts. Yes, I want to be entertained, but I also want to learn and be challenged. In contrast to the commentary-driven media, I suppose this is expert-driven media.</p>
<p>The reality is that most people prefer the commentary-driven approach. They feel part of the conversation. They can contribute if they want. They want to hear the opinions of others and argue about topics. Our current social media landscape was designed for them. They want to feel that their opinion is a vital part of the conversation. That is the format.</p>
<p>Cultivating an expert-driven media environment is tougher and it appeals to a smaller audience. But there <em>is</em> a significant audience. There are plenty of people who want to read posts and articles from people who know what they are talking about. An ample audience of people who want to listen to podcasts and watch informative videos. We just have to design a system that prioritizes meaningful content and encourages sharing well-thought out responses over quick, thoughtless knee-jerk commentary.</p>
<p>With the implosion of Twitter, I feel like we have an opportunity to build something different. I’m happy with Micro.Blog right now and look forward to its continued development. I’m interested in the resurgence of RSS <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  and the momentum behind new indie-web protocols like ActivityPub. I’m encouraged that so many people are experimenting with different approaches to “social” media. I can’t wait to see what comes next.</p>

			 <p>Our house is on a golf course that went out of business. Long story, but the course was eventually purchased by the original developer and gifted to the local rec commission. It’s taken a while for them to rebuild pedestrian bridges and do some improvements, but now, the park has about 4.5 miles of (very hilly) trails accessible from our back yard. Went on a wonderful walk with my wife this weekend and discovered trails I never knew existed.</p>

			 <h2 id="trying-to-find-balance">Trying to find balance</h2>
<p>I’ll be honest, I’m not sure I ever found my footing after the pandemic shut everything down. I’ve been trucking along keeping everything going, but the last half of 2022 was especially challenging. This rhythm and pace is not sustainable and it’s time to reset the balance between family, work and school.</p>
<p>Family is first, as always, but even more so now that my oldest is about to head off to college. I want to spend quality time with her before she moves out and heads to school. Work is going well, but is constantly busy. With graduate school, I’m taking the spring semester off to spend some time getting into a new routine.</p>
<p>For 2023, I need to focus on four areas: health, writing, organization and creativity.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-physical-and-mental-health">Focus on physical and mental health</h3>
<p>I’ve got a list of things to work on — from getting enough sleep to finding time to walk at lunch. I feel like I know what I need to do, but making time for a healthy life has been challenging over the last year. I need to develop consistent, healthy habits.</p>
<h3 id="write-more">Write more</h3>
<p>I’ve been writing for school almost constantly for the last year. And that’s great, but it’s come at the expense of writing for myself. I’ll still be writing for grad school, and hopefully getting some journal articles published this year, but I want to expand the type of writing I’m doing and improve my skills. Writing on bobwertz.com (via Micro.Blog) is going to be my primary personal writing outlet for the year.</p>
<h3 id="smartly-organized">Smartly organized</h3>
<p>In general, I’m organized, but there are some areas that are an absolute train wreck. I’m working on some using the tools I have — like Notion and Tot — more effectively. There’s a fine line here, though. Time spent on getting organized is time that I’m not working out, writing or designing.</p>
<h3 id="rediscover-creative-endeavors">Rediscover creative endeavors</h3>
<p>I’m a designer, but I’m not designing much right now. I have a bunch of projects, from stickers to typefaces that I want to work on. These always end up on the back burner when family commitments and grad school deadlines take priority. I need to carve out some time for visually creative projects that I’ve been neglecting.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m looking forward to hitting the reset button and restoring some balance to my slightly chaotic life. In past years, I’ve shared a check-in post at the midpoint of the year to evaluate how I’m doing on my theme and goals. This year, I’m going to try and post quarterly to keep myself accountable.</p>

			 <h2 id="time-to-reset-the-balance">Time to reset the balance</h2>
<p>“I don’t know how you do it?”</p>
<p>I get this question a lot. I balance a full-time job, my family and grad school. I’ve been in grad school part time since I started my Master’s program in 2018 and I’ve become pretty good at carefully planning out and scheduling my time.</p>
<p>In 2022, I never really had a chance to achieve a balance. At work, there was a lot of change. My boss resigned in January and I assumed some of his responsibilities. I took over managing photography and videography staff again. <a href="https://sc.edu/uofsc/posts/2022/10/branding-streamline-announcement.php#.Y6CCCy-B2Lc">We rolled out a new logo,</a> which was — and still is — a lot of work. All of these things were positive developments, but required increasingly more of my time and attention.</p>
<p>At home, things were challenging. My wife tore her bicep in January and then had to have surgery in the summer, right as she was moving to a different school.  My oldest started her senior year of high school and is trying to figure out where she wants to go to college, but then tore her ACL in a lacrosse tournament and also had to have surgery. My two youngest each started a new school, which changed our morning routine significantly. Everyone is doing great, but there is always a lot going on.</p>
<p>And grad school has been <em>fine</em>. I’ve done well. I’ve written lots of papers that I am proud of and had research accepted to a conference. I’m trying to get my papers edited and submitted to journals. Classes have been good, but honestly, I haven’t enjoyed grad school for the last year. And that has been weighing on me.</p>
<p>The balance is off.</p>
<p>I’ve been in grad school part-time for 4.5 years straight at this point — 3 for the Master’s and 1.5 for the Ph.D. With all the changes in my job and life, I wasn’t getting the most out of my Ph.D. studies.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  So I’ve decided to take the spring semester off. It’s a tough decision — I’ve been steadily working on my degrees one or two classes at a time — but it’s the right decision. I need to pause and reset the balance between work, home and school. I’m not quitting, just taking a break. I know I’ll start back up in the summer or fall, fully recharged and ready to continue to the finish.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>One of my professors told me that by working on my Ph.D. part time, I had the “gift of time.” Most people have to sprint through their program so they can get a teaching job. By not rushing through my program, I could get the most out of it and enjoy it.</li>

			 <h2 id="testing-out-how-i-want-to-format-my-longer-posts">Testing out how I want to format my longer posts.</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had this Micro.Blog site for long, but I&rsquo;ve written at my other site &ndash; <a href="https://sketchbookb.com">Sketchbook B</a> &ndash; for almost 15 years.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Over time, my long form blog posts there developed a pattern. I had a basic structure with headers, footnotes, divider lines and a bio at the end. And I want to replicate some of that here and needed a post to experiment with. This is that post.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already been using an H2 as a subhead and I like the way that looks. Like many writers, I often want to add footnotes as I write. Over on Sketchbook B, I used asterisks, but since I&rsquo;m writing in Markdown, that&rsquo;s kind of a pain in the ass. So I figured I&rsquo;d go with superscript numbers, which is more conventional anyway.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  I continue to use divider lines to separate the body of the post from the footnotes, and a second divider line between the footnotes and a bio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I want to do with the bio. I found that most of my traffic came from Google, so the reader was dropping in on my site with no idea who I was. For now, I&rsquo;ve decided to go with the shortest one sentence bio that I could and set it at the end in italics.</p>
<p>One aspect that I haven&rsquo;t yet decided on is images. On my Squarespace-hosted site, each post had a preview image and I&rsquo;d include a post image. So far on bobwertz.com, I don&rsquo;t need a preview image, but I do think I want to create some type of standard post image to include under the subhead. I&rsquo;ll keep experimenting, but I feel good about my basic post format.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to keep writing at Sketchbook B, but the content will be mostly Adobe Creative Cloud tips.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m using a trial of MarsEdit right now. And I really love the preview engine that lets me see how this is going to look, even before I post it. Looks like I&rsquo;ll be purchasing a license.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t love how the superscripts mess with the overall line spacing. It just feels wrong. I may try to come up with another approach.</li>

			 <h2 id="my-8-from-2022">My ❤️8️⃣ from 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣2️⃣</h2>
<p>This year was unexpected. Just about nothing went as planned — sometimes better, sometimes worse. Looking back over my photos, I took fewer “artsy” shots and mostly focused on my family. Here are my favorite shots from the past year, starting top left:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67587/2022/d03bcd6149.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Evening snowfall.</strong> We don’t get much snow in Columbia, South Carolina. When it snowed in the evening in January, every thing was peaceful and serene… and then it was fun and chaotic, when all neighborhood kids came outside to play in the snow.</p>
<p><strong>Norah’s prom.</strong> Our oldest headed to prom and had a great time with her friends.</p>
<p><strong>Jill’s birthday.</strong> There are nine candles on the cake. Not the correct number of candles, but the perfect amount of light.</p>
<p><strong>Soda City Market.</strong> We headed to our local market and took this picture as we were leaving. I’m not exactly sure what’s going on here — Jill hugs her kettle corn while Ryan proudly presents a giant carrot — but I love the shot.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan playing the viola.</strong> Ryan started playing the viola this year and seems to enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Sunrise at Hilton Head.</strong> Took a trip to Hilton Head with the family and woke up early enough to catch sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>Lizzy’s birthday selfie.</strong> Here’s the thing… Our selfies are typically terrible and we have to take a bunch to get anything usable, but I grabbed this shot at Liz’s birthday dinner and we both like it. So it has to be one of my favorites.</p>
<p><strong>Skee-Ball.</strong> I love skee-ball, and this beautiful skee-ball machine was at the arcade where we had Ryan’s birthday party.</p>
<p>This is the fifth year I’ve done a Favorite 8. You can see my previous posts from <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/12/27/fav8">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/12/14/fav-8-gt-best-9?rq=fav8">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2020/12/31/2020-fav8?rq=fav8">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2021/12/28/2021-fav8?rq=fav8">2021</a> on my other site, Sketchbook B.</p>

			 <h2 id="picking-out-my-favorite-pictures-from-the-last-year">Picking out my favorite pictures from the last year.</h2>
<p>Back in 2018, Instagram users started posting their algorithmically-generated “Best Nine” — essentially the nine shots from the year that had the most likes. When I looked at mine, the images that everyone else liked weren’t necessarily my favorite pictures from the previous year. I enjoyed the process of digging through all the images from the previous year — many of which I had forgotten about. I curated and built my #Fav8 in <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/12/27/fav8">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/12/14/fav-8-gt-best-9?rq=fav8">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2020/12/31/2020-fav8?rq=fav8">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2021/12/28/2021-fav8?rq=fav8">2021</a>. If you are interested in learning more about the thought process behind Favorite 8, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/12/27/fav8">the 2018 post</a> has the most detail.</p>
<p>This year, I’m not posting to Twitter, so I’m ditching the #Fav8 hashtag and just going with “Favorite 8.” Although on Micro.Blog, I’m thinking ❤️8️⃣ might be appropriate.</p>
<p>In the past, several friends have done this too, so this is just a reminder that it’s time to start working on selecting your Favorite 8 shots from 2022. I’ll probably post mine next week.</p>

<p>There’s lots of hype about Mastodon as people flee Twitter, but lately, I’ve been thinking about how brands will function on federated social sites.</p>
<p>If the big brands in the world are going to give Mastodon a shot, they aren’t going to just join an existing instance… they’ll host their own server for all of their related accounts. Let’s say you are a large international brand like Starbucks. Are you going to use @starbucks@mastodon.social? Not when you can have @official@starbucks.com, @news@starbucks.com, and @customercare@starbucks.com. If you run your own instance, you never have to worry about someone grabbing a handle you wanted to use. No worries about the content moderation policy on the instance you’ve selected. And because of the way ActivityPub works, your posts will be visible across Mastodon and other compatible services. As a bonus, it’s much harder for a fraudulent account to spoof you if you connect your federated social account to your primary domain name.</p>
<p>(In reality, someone will create a service to manage this for brands and charge big money for it, because there is no way a corporate IT department is going to accept the risk of running a Mastodon instance.)</p>

			 <h2 id="content-is-more-important-than-commentary">Content is more important than commentary.</h2>
<p>When the internet was becoming popular, I remember being told that traditional media was just broadcasting. The internet promised more than just broadcasting, it offered “engagement.”</p>
<p>Don’t let people fool you. Engagement happened before the internet. People read the newspaper and talked about stories with their family and friends. They watched the evening news and discussed it at the water cooler at work the next day. They wrote letters to the editor to express their agreement or disapproval. They called radio shows to ask questions. They bought classified ads to share a job listing or sell a car. People engaged with media before the internet.</p>
<p>Instead, what the internet offered was an instant, two-way feedback loop between publisher and audience. Comments on blogs and news sites led the way. Then, social media provided the ultimate in real time engagement with metrics that let you track everything.</p>
<p>Instant response. Maximum engagement. Integrated with the content.</p>
<p>And how has that worked out? Thoughtful comments on blogs were quickly drowned out with spam. News sites were filled with reactionary opinions. Social media offered both reactionary opinions and spam <em>and as a bonus</em> channeled hate and harassment. Managing commentary takes as much staff and resources as creating the content, but people love providing their opinion and arguing their point of view, which drives traffic. And that traffic was the most important thing to the companies like Facebook and Twitter that sell the advertising that surrounds the hate.</p>
<p>As Twitter implodes and some people look for what’s next, I think we need to reexamine the relationship between publishing and engagement. Creation and commentary. True engagement is what follows when we create high-quality, beneficial content. We need to restore a focus on publishing the content, not just on the commentary. And our new technologies need to support that balance.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>P.S. One of the things I like about Micro.Blog is the absence of metrics. No follower counts. No likes. No retweets. If you are used to obsessively checking how many likes your last post got, the absence of metrics takes a little getting used to, but it resets the balance between publishing and engagement.</em></p>
<p><em>P.S.S. It occurs to me that the most profitable company in the world, Apple, creates a lot of content without maintaining a traditional social media presence.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m been an AIGA member for much of my professional career. I was active at a chapter level for over a decade. Over that time, people repeatedly tried to reimagine the central organization, its chapter system and its funding mechanisms. No one was ever satisfied. They wanted to make it better, and then <em>every designer</em> would want to join and <em>help change the world.</em></p>
<p>And yet, the organization got smaller.</p>
<p>AIGA has meant a lot to me and it definitely helped my career, but structurally, it’s been broken for a long time. It was built in a pre-Internet era. A time when the only way you got to see a legendary designer was to go to a conference or have them come to a local AIGA chapter. When networking was done primarily at the local bar. A time when being aligned with a large national organization gave you needed credibility and clout.</p>
<p>But now, YouTube means you can see all of your favorite designers deliver inspirational talks from the comfort of your own home. You can network with anyone, anywhere, anytime. The world changed, but the structure remained, and that was before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>AIGA isn’t alone. Lots of member-based organizations are trying to figure out how to move forward. These organizations can bring value to their members, but they will need to embrace a different approach, building valuable online communities that may or may not be connected with local chapters.</p>
<p>In the end, we’ll see how AIGA&rsquo;s latest re-envisioning works out. I’m optimistic, but time will tell if they are able to make the hard choices.</p>

			 <h2 id="worth-every-penny">Worth every penny</h2>
<p>It seems like everything is going to subscription pricing. I subscribe to a whole host of streaming services, bundles, news sites, and software. Many of them don’t always seem worth the money, but as I look at what I subscribe to, I realize that I don’t mind supporting products and creators that I love. So here are a list of services that I really, really like and happily pay for:</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/"><strong>Micro.Blog</strong> <em>$5/month</em></a></p>
<p>I backed the Micro.Blog Kickstarter and I’ve had a paid subscription ever since — even when I wasn’t using it every day. I’m happy to support a product with a viewpoint that aligns with my values, and Micro.Blog is that type of service. Now that Twitter is unstable, I’m glad Micro.Blog is my home base.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade"><strong>Upgrade+</strong> <em>$5/month</em></a></p>
<p>I’ve listened to Myke Hurley and Jason Snell talk about Apple and the larger tech industry on Upgrade since 2014. I listen to a lot of podcasts, but this is the one I listen to <em>every</em> Monday. Paying for the “+” gets me ad-free episodes and an extra segment, but, I’m just happy to support a show I love.</p>
<p><a href="http://sixcolors.com"><strong>Six Colors</strong> <em>$6/month</em></a></p>
<p>Jason Snell and Dan Moren write Six Colors. I get additional articles and an extra podcast on Friday afternoons, but again, a way to support writers that I like. (Dan also writes a series of science fiction spy novels that I like a lot. <a href="https://dmoren.com/writing/galactic-cold-war/">Check them out, too.</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://ulysses.app"><strong>Ulysses</strong> <em>$29.99/year</em></a></p>
<p>A distraction-free writing app that lets me write in Markdown. I’ve used Ulysses for a long time and almost everything I write starts here (including this post).</p>
<p><a href="https://fontstruct.com"><strong>Fontstruct</strong> <em>5€/month</em></a></p>
<p>I don’t spend a ton of time over on Fontstruct, but I love it dearly. Fontstruct lets you build modular fonts and export them. Tons of fun and a great community. It’s free to use, but the 5 euros helps pay the bills.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so"><strong>Notion</strong> <em>$5/month</em></a></p>
<p>Notion is… a lot of different things in one package. I use it for tracking tasks, managing grad school projects, jotting notes and planning for the future. Well worth the $5 a month.</p>
<p><a href="http://zotero.org"><strong>Zotero</strong> <em>$20/year</em></a></p>
<p>I’m a Ph.D. student. Zotero is a citation manager that lets me track all of the sources I need for my papers. It’s not the prettiest app, but it’s incredibly powerful. Free to use, but by $20/year gets me more cloud storage. In a couple of years, I’ll happily upgrade to the $60/year plan. Worth every penny.</p>

			 <h2 id="preparing-for-a-future-without-twitter">Preparing for a future without Twitter.</h2>
<p>I’ve been preparing for the demise of Twitter since long before Elon Musk made the offer to purchase it. In 2016, I wrote a post — <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2016/11/9/twitterless">Twitterless</a> — about what would happen if Twitter “disappeared tomorrow.” I outlined a couple of key areas that would be problematic for me and possible solutions.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, I wrote a follow up post — <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/3/twitterless-part-ii?rq=twitterless">Twitterless, Part II</a> — that noted my progress on replacing the role Twitter plays for me, and the challenges that still existed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Times are changing, though, and I honestly believe that we all need to be diversifying — and if possible, owning — our social media presence. Becoming less reliant on the big social media behemoths is the first step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ended that post with a promise to follow up on my progress, but as Facebook became more and more evil, I focused <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2019/6/22/another-why-i-am-quitting-facebook-post?rq=facebook">on moving away from Facebook.</a> Replacing Twitter was pushed to the back burner.</p>
<p>Now that Twitter armageddon may or may not be here, it’s clearly time that I renew my quest to find an alternative. I figured I’d check back in on those questions that I asked back in 2016 and see how I’ve done:</p>
<p><strong>I’d lose a bunch of contacts.</strong> Yep. I’m going to lose a bunch of people who follow me on Twitter. I’ve tried to connect with people on other platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram, but I can’t find everyone, and you know what, I’m okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>I’d change how I watch live events.</strong> This is still a problem as <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2022/11/06/live-events-and.html">I noted yesterday.</a> Live events are fun to follow with other people, and Twitter is great for that. No other service is quite like Twitter for those instant commentary events.</p>
<p><strong>I’d have to rethink how I find articles and stories.</strong> I use <a href="http://www.feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> as an RSS reader, but that’s not my only solution. I subscribe directly to <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post.</em> And — as shocking as it might seem — I also get a lot of value out of Apple News+, which I get with our Apple One bundle. My local paper, <em>The State</em>, is included in with Apple News+ and I catch a random assortment of articles from sources I don’t normally read. It’s a nice way to diversify the news I see every day.</p>
<p><strong>I’d have to rethink how I share content.</strong> When I wrote this, I felt like traffic to my blog was coming primarily from Twitter, but over time, that lessened and most come through search engines. I’ll still create and share, but I’ll just use whatever channels are available at the time.</p>
<p><strong>I’d change the way I use Facebook/Instagram.</strong> I once thought that Facebook and Instagram might provide a solution. I’ve mostly left Facebook, and Meta seems to only care about the Metaverse now anyway. I’m not that interested in Instagram now that it’s trying to be TikTok. I don’t feel any better about Facebook than I do about Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>I’d try to find a replacement.</strong> I backed the <a href="%5Bhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing%5D">Micro.Blog Kickstarter</a> back in 2017 and I’ve had a paid account ever since. I originally <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com/journal/2018/1/17/microblog-and-squarespace">connected Micro.Blog to my Squarespace site</a>, which worked well over the years. I believe in the idea of a feed-based, open social media platform, but because I was still using Twitter, I didn’t fully commit to using Micro.Blog.</p>
<p>I’ve still got <a href="http://www.sketchbookb.com">Sketchbook B</a> and it’s still hosted on Squarespace, but I made the decision this summer that all of my future blog and short-form posting will be hosted on Micro.Blog, specifically, <a href="http://www.bobwertz.com">bobwertz.com</a>. Why? I love the community, and the platform lets me easily post my content and crosspost to other services if I want to. It also lets me follow people who post on Mastodon, and they can follow me at <a href="https://micro.blog/bobwertz@bobwertz.com">@bobwertz@bobwertz.com</a>. I like writing my blog posts in Ulysses in Markdown and the just post them directly to my site. I feel Micro.Blog gives me the best of all of the potential options and I’m happy with that choice.</p>
<p>Looking back, I think I’ve prepared pretty well for the potential downfall of Twitter. I’m not leaving completely, but I’ve got one foot out the door and I feel good about the solutions I’ve worked out for me.</p>
<p>If Twitter ceases to be enjoyable, I’ll leave. To be honest, I’ll miss it. I joined in 2008 and 14 years is a long time to use any service. It’s part of my daily routine. At the end of the day, though, if a service isn’t making my life better, I’m better off without it.</p>

			 <p>One thing that Twitter excels at — which will be difficult to replace — is commentary during live events. Last night, I was able to follow a range of commentary on several college football games and the World Series all from my Twitter feed.</p>
<p>It’s not just who I follow, it’s also the way the service is constructed. When following a bunch of live events, you need to use the non-algorithmic timeline. Twitter still, begrudgingly, allows for that. Facebook has many of the people I follow on Twitter, but the comments are jumbled, appearing whenever the algorithm decides, often incoherently out of order. And I can’t see following my South Carolina Gamecocks on another large service, like Linked In. 🤣</p>
<p>Perhaps the real question is if I need the stream of commentary at all? I get value out of live commentary from sports journalists and other fans. I feel like it ads to my enjoyment, but I enjoyed watching games before Twitter existed. Maybe live events is one of those areas where I need to reexamine my reliance on social media.</p>

			 <h2 id="two-notable-logo-trends-from-apple">Two notable logo trends from Apple</h2>
<p><em>This post was originally posted on April 22, 2021 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>Apple has one of the most recognizable logos in the world. Which isn’t surprising because they are the largest company in the world. I’ve been watching a couple of trends over the last few months about how Apple uses their logos and this week, those trends have become even more apparent. For brand managers and designers, I think there is something interesting going on and it’s worth digging into the mystery.</p>
<h3 id="the-logo-is-missing">The logo is “missing.”</h3>
<p>Apple isn’t afraid to use their logos. All of their computers have prominent logos. They include logo stickers in all of their boxes. Apple’s logo is everywhere. But on their new iMac, which was released this week, Apple’s logo is on the back, but not on the front. The last few generations of iMac’s have featured a prominent logo on the back and a second logo on the “chin,” facing the user. The new iMac has no user facing logo.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But the iMac isn’t the only recent Apple product with an interesting logo story. I first noticed Apple’s changing logo use with the introduction of the AirPod Max, which has no Apple logos at all on the product. There is plenty of room for a logo on the side of the headphones, but there is none to be found.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I guessed the AirPods Max was the only Apple product without a logo, but I was wrong. For some reason I assumed that my AirPods case had the Apple logo on it, but guess what? It doesn’t. I checked Apple’s website and the AirPods Pro don’t have a logo either. (Although according to Apple’s website and an iFixit teardown, the chip inside the AirPods Pro has a tiny logo printed on it.) My Apple Watch has a tiny Apple logo on the bottom on it, but it’s not visible when it’s being worn. Apple doesn’t include logos on any of their wearable products.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But that’s not all. I’ve been trying out Apple Fitness+ and there are tons of visible logos. Nike logos. All of the instructors seem to be wearing Nike gear. There are no Apple logos. No special Apple Fitness+ shirts. No little Apple “watermark” in the corner of the screen. An Apple logo isn’t hidden somewhere on the set.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I checked Apple’s competitors. Amazon, Samsung and Microsoft all include their logo on the charging case for their AirPod competitors. Sony and Google even managed to get their logo on the earbud itself. None of the competing smartwatches that I looked at had logos, although Samsung etched “Galaxy Watch” into the crown for some reason.</p>
<p>In the fitness space, Peloton employees sport logo apparel while they lead classes. And the instructors on Nike’s fitness apps obviously sport Nike gear.</p>
<p>So what’s going on? I’m not sure.</p>
<p>My first reaction is it’s just an issue of taste. Placing logos all over a product is tacky — especially for wearables. And Apple is showing their superior taste by acknowledging that consumers don’t always want to be sporting company logos. Maybe? But lots of premium and luxury brands include logos on their products. And Apple isn’t exactly shy about using their logo.</p>
<p>It’s not about the logo size. Even the Apple Pencil has a logo. And as I mentioned, the chips inside the AirPods have logos printed on them. (The chips… inside the case… that the consumer never sees…)</p>
<p>The absence of a logo is even stranger when you realize the original intent of a trademarked logo: to clearly identify the manufacturer. With a company like Apple, whose designs are ripped off more than about any other tech company, their logo is the part of the design that absolutely can’t be legally copied.</p>
<p>My best guess is that Apple thinks that their product designs are unique enough, that they don’t even need a logo. People will know AirPods are an Apple product when they see them. The Apple Fitness+ workouts feel like Apple even if their logo isn’t present. I don’t think any other company can make a desktop computer that looks like the new iMac. Apple’s presence is understood because of the overall production quality and design. A logo isn’t necessary.</p>
<h3 id="the-logo-is-incognito">The logo is “incognito.”</h3>
<p>Typical corporate logo standards are incredibly strict. Apple doesn’t publish their internal brand guidelines, but it’s clear they do allow some more playful uses of their mark. For example, they often use illustrated versions of their logo to promote their media events, like they did for this week’s Spring Forward event. Allowing logo variations in large corporate identity systems isn’t uncommon, but those variations are typically used for structural identifications between organizational divisions or product lines.</p>
<p>But Apple is using logo variants that align with their values.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In 2014, Apple started using a logo with a green leaf in their retail stores on Earth Day. This logo seems to be used mostly in Apple retail, but showed up this week on the Apple home page for Earth Day 2021 and their updated environmental statement.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And in this week’s presentation, they showed their privacy Apple variation, which is often animated and turns the leaf at the top of their logo into a lock. It’s used in ads, videos and sites when Apple is talking about their commitment to privacy. What’s smart about this approach is that Apple is using their logo to not just communicate their identity, but also their corporate values.</p>
<p>(It’s worth noting that there are a couple of other logo variants as well: a gift that is used during the holidays and a version for their Marina Bay Sands retail store in Singapore. And I’m sure there are others as well.)</p>
<h3 id="what-lessons-can-we-take-from-apples-approach-to-logo-management">What lessons can we take from Apple’s approach to logo management?</h3>
<p>Apple’s visual branding is clearly effective. Repetition and consistency are the foundation of contemporary brand management, but Apple has decided to not use their logo in some places and change it in others. This ongoing shift in logo usage isn’t accidental or ill-considered. A couple of lessons to think about:</p>

<p><strong>Everything doesn’t need a logo.</strong> In the 1990s, branding meant putting the logo on everything, but is it really necessary? (It isn’t.) Logos are important, but they aren’t the only way you communicate your identity. Apple’s using their logos smartly, and not over using their marks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Differentiation happens with the design around the logo.</strong> Apple’s products are identified by their look and feel. Yes, the logo is part of that, but Apple’s visual branding extends far beyond just their logo. Their brand is expressed as much through the surrounding elements — type, color, materials — as it is through their logo. Their visual differentiation extends far beyond just their logo and their identity is stronger for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think about how a visual identity can reflect a company’s values.</strong> Most of the time, visual identity reflects an organization’s structure, but connecting your visual brand to your corporate values is potentially more powerful. Apple uses logo variations that support their beliefs, not their hierarchy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll never hear from their branding team and Apple doesn’t publicly share their logo and branding guidelines. We’ll just have to watch as they rollout ads, events and products. But it’s clear that Apple is diverging from the standard brand playbook here and I think we should pay attention to where they go next.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>This post was originally posted on July 4, 2019 on Sketchbook B. It’s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>I grew up loving magazines. Any time I’d be interested in something, I’d head to the magazine aisle in the bookstore or grocery store and look for magazines on the topic. Computers, cars, boats, science, model railroads, photography, sports, baseball cards, comics, design and more. It didn’t matter what I was interested in, there was at least one magazine on the topic.</p>
<p>Growing up in the pre-internet days, these magazines provided the info I was looking for. Detailed, up-to-date, authoritative info about whatever geeky habits I was interested in. Even the ads were informative and useful. I subscribed to some of them. Others, I’d buy if the main topics that month interested me.</p>
<p>The internet destroyed these publications. The first blow came from blogs. Authoritative people writing about the things they loved that people could read for free. The second blow was Google, which could route you to exactly what you were looking for. For various reasons — mostly related to monetization — the blog revolution failed to really take hold. Google’s search engine algorithm seemed to reward people with better SEO tactics over more authoritative sources. When I search Google for resources today, it’s hard to tell if what I’ve found is up-to-date or reputable. More often than not, I’m led to dated post of questionable origin that barely answers my question.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I was excited about the introduction of Apple News+. Access to hundreds of magazines for $10 a month. The service is nothing world-changing. I’ve absolutely gotten my money’s worth and will continue to subscribe. Surprisingly, though, I discovered I’d already filled the need for a detailed, up-to-date, authoritative source for my geeky habits: podcasting.</p>
<p>I use podcasts the same way I used special interest magazines as a kid.</p>
<p>If I’m interested in a topic, I find a podcast. Computers, design, photography, business, pens, science fiction, pop culture, sports, meditation and more. I subscribe to many of these podcasts in Overcast<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, while others I only listen to a few episodes. Even the ads are informative and relevant. Podcasts are how I learn about and explore new topics.</p>
<p>Some people think of podcasting as an evolution of talk radio. Others feel it’s more an audio form of blogging. I suppose I don’t have an issue with either of those opinions, but for me, podcasts serve a vital role as a replacement for the special interest magazine.</p>

			 <h3 id="designers-dont-want-to-admit-it-but-math-is-important-to-the-profession">Designers don’t want to admit it, but math is important to the profession.</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>This post was originally posted on September 29, 2015 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>My first class in graduate school was a quantitive research class and I really enjoyed the statistics side of things. As I’ve told my designer friends this, they typically respond with something along the lines of “Ugh. I became a designer so I wouldn’t have to do math.” I’m not surprised. I’ve heard the same from designers and students over the years, but I’m increasingly irritated by it for a few reasons:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designers use math every day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I’m not sure where the myth that designers don’t need to understand math comes from, but it’s not true.  I use math pretty much every day in my work. Especially geometry and algebra. Understanding foundational mathematical concepts makes you a better designer.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It steers talent away from the field.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Let’s say you’ve got a talented high school kid, who also happens to be good at — or maybe even like — math. Tell them enough times that math isn’t important for designers and they’ll find a different career path. As an honors student, I was told repeatedly through school by well-meaning adults that I didn’t want to take art classes because they weren’t rigorous enough. As a result, I initially looked at options like architecture and engineering. It took me a while to circle around to design.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It undermines the profession.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The reality is that designers struggle to be taken seriously by big business. We’ve fought to get a “seat at the table” and prove our value beyond just crafting the look and feel of something. As much as we don’t like it, the “language” of business is often based in math. Ignoring the importance of math simply makes it harder to communicate with business decision makers.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think the challenge is separating our feelings about “math class” from our feelings about “math.” I didn’t enjoy most of my high school math classes. My algebra and geometry teachers weren’t my favorites. Because I scored a high enough score on my AP Calculus test, I was able to exempt all of my college math requirements, so I haven’t taken a math class in almost 25 years. What I’ve come to realize is that while I disliked the way I was taught math, math itself is pretty amazing. And useful.</p>
<p>Don’t misunderstand me… I’m not expecting designers to line up and take refresher math classes. AIGA chapters aren’t going to start holding day-long math workshops. All I’m saying is that embracing the idea that math is an integral part of design only helps the profession as a whole.</p>

			 <p><em>This post was originally posted on January 7, 2018 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>I made a red velvet cake last week.</p>
<p>From scratch. It was a recipe that my mom made when I was growing up, but it was originally my Grandmother Wertz’s recipe. My grandmother died when I was very young, so to me, red velvet always makes me think of my mom.</p>
<p>My mom passed away almost 17 years ago. She taught me to cook many things, but this red velvet cake was not one of them. All I knew was that it was difficult, and that she messed up the icing the first time she tried to make it. I can make pretty much anything that she made, but I had never tried to make the red velvet cake. I’ll be honest – I was scared. Scared to fail. Afraid that if I messed it up, I wouldn’t have someone to call for advice. I was on my own. So I never attempted it.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I started thinking about making her red velvet cake. I don’t know what triggered my urge to bake the unbakeable, but I couldn’t get the idea out of my head. I got the recipe from my sister and decided to bake the cake Christmas Eve. (Because obviously, we had nothing else to do that night…) I ran to the grocery store and got the ingredients. I found our fanciest cake stand. And I pulled out the Kitchen Aid mixer that my parents gave us as a wedding gift.</p>
<p>The recipe wasn’t that hard, but like most older recipes, it was procedural. Lots of steps and precise measurements. The cake batter came together okay, but the icing was another story. This recipe doesn’t use a cream cheese icing like a lot of modern red velvet cakes do. It’s more like a butter cream. I ruined the first batch of icing and had to make a second batch. About 1:00 Christmas morning, I finished icing the cake. It looked exactly like I remembered.</p>
<p>Christmas evening, after dinner, we cut into the red velvet cake – giant pie-sized wedges like my mom used to cut. It tasted like I remembered. Not too sweet, perfect texture. Even the kids loved it. I will freely admit that I teared up a little upon realizing that I had successfully pulled it off.</p>
<p>As I think about the year ahead, I realize that many of the things I’ve been scared of… many of the things I’ve put off attempting… the fear is all in my head. In 2018, I’m going to put those fears aside, branch out and try new things.</p>
<p>(And now that I can make the red velvet cake, I’m definitely going to bake it again.)</p>

			 <h2 id="a-year-ago-i-decided-to-lessen-my-reliance-on-twitter-heres-my-progress-so-far">A year ago, I decided to lessen my reliance on Twitter. Here&rsquo;s my progress so far&hellip;</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>This post was originally posted on January 3, 2018 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>A little over a year ago, <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2016/11/09/twitterless.html">I wrote a blog post pondering what would change in my workflow if Twitter disappeared.</a> At the time, Twitter was actively looking for buyers and had just shut down Vine. I identified what I would miss without Twitter and decided to start looking for options to address some potential pain points.</p>
<p>In the last year, the narrative has shifted from Twitter’s possible sale to issues with abuse and hatred. Twitter increased the character count to 280 and that’s worked out fine, but its user growth is still flat. As Twitter tries to jumpstart the service, I still believe the likelihood of Twitter imploding within the next few years is high.</p>
<p>I thought I’d revisit my areas of concern <a href="https://bobwertz.com/2016/11/09/twitterless.html">from my previous post</a> and share what I’ve done to mitigate those issues.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d lose a bunch of contacts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> My first concern was that I’d lose a bunch of contacts that I only had on Twitter. I’m a little less concerned about this than I was a year ago. I’ve slowly started to connect with more people, experts and brands on other services like LinkedIn and Facebook. I’ve still got a ways to go and will continue to expand the roster of people I follow on other services.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d change how I watch live events.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I’m still using Twitter during live events. For me, this is the hardest to replace. During the Sugar Bowl and the Rose Bowl this week,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I kept up with commentary from reporters and friends on Twitter. Following commentary on live events is challenging through Facebook. Posts don’t appear in sequential order because of their algorithm.</p>
<p>Twitter is simply the best option to handle streaming written commentary during an event. I’m sure I could use something like Snapchat, but I don’t know enough people on Snapchat for it to be useful for me.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d have to rethink how I find articles and stories.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This was a big issue for me, but I’ve kind of solved it… by cheating a little bit. I’ve started using Nuzzel<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> to surface headlines from my social media services. Not familiar with Nuzzel? It’s a pretty simple service. You connect your social media services — Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn — and Nuzzel tells you what links your friends (and friends of your friends) are sharing. This works really well for finding the links and articles that your social circle is talking about… without actually going into Twitter or Facebook. It’s cheating because 95% of the links that come up are from people I follow on Twitter. I really like the service and I see lots of links I would have otherwise missed. I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>I’ve upgraded to Feedly Pro and I’m being more intentional about subscribing to interesting RSS feeds. I’m going to continue to expand my use of Feedly.</p>
<p>I find Facebook useless for finding actual news stories unless I want to know “27 Secrets from The Last Jedi” or some crappy, clickbait slideshow link. And LinkedIn seems equally useless for finding content that I’m interested in.</p>
<p>I need to give Medium another chance, but for some reason, I just haven’t been interested in building an account on Medium with people I follow and read regularly. Maybe that’s something to look into more in 2018.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d have to rethink how I share content.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Sharing the content I create is another issue. I’m sharing more widely on other services, but I’m still using Twitter. For 2018, I’m shifting most of my short format posting to Micro.Blog with automatic cross posting to Twitter.</p>
<p>And to promote most of my blog posts or interesting content, I schedule posts through Buffer to several different services.</p>
<p>I’ve thought about reposting my blog posts and articles on Medium, but it seems like a lot of work to post everything twice. (And only posting to Medium is not an option for me. I want everything hosted on my site.) I may try Medium again.</p>
<p>I’ve tried and I’ve tried, but I can’t get into Dribbble. I love the concept and I love the community, but it just doesn’t match up with the way I work. Still, the community is great so maybe I’ll give it another shot in 2018.</p>
<p>And finally, Pinterest. For some of my content — specifically my shirt and product designs — Pinterest is a great service. But I haven’t really spent that much time in Pinterest personally, so that might be another avenue I explore in 2018.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d change the way I use Facebook.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> So Facebook… I really do think that we’ve reached the point where you have to have a Facebook account, unfortunately. In today’s communications environment, Facebook is a necessary evil. Over the last year, Facebook has had its own problems with hatred, fake news and discrimination, though, and I&rsquo;d love to reduce my reliance on Facebook, too.</p>
<p>Facebook is a great place to share family photos, but for serious content, I don’t think it works well. I’ve started to build an audience for the Sketchbook B Facebook page and I’m going to continue to promote the page and hopefully expand the number of followers. That said, I feel like Facebook’s algorithm is going to hide my content unless I pay to promote it, which I may start to do selectively.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d spend more time on Instagram.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I still love Instagram.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> A couple years ago, I switched my account from a personal account to a business account. The bonus was that I could see viewer metrics, but the drawback was that it would only let me cross post to my Facebook Sketchbook B business page, not my personal profile. Since most of my Instagram shots are family or fun shots, I want to cross post those to my personal Facebook page. I don’t really care about metrics so I recently switched back to the personal account.</p>
<p>I plan to cross post my fun family Instagram images to Twitter and Facebook more regularly. I also plan to manually repost from Instagram to Micro.Blog. It’s a little bit of work, but I like having everything on my site.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d try to find a replacement.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> A little over a year ago, I was guessing that if Twitter disappeared, someone would rise up and meet the needs of its former user base. I didn’t have to wait until Twitter disappeared. A few months after I wrote my post, Manton Reece launched his Micro.Blog Kickstarter project. Micro.Blog is a service that allows me to host my microblog posts — basically, tweets — on my own site and then share through a social media service. Manton’s done a great job so far, and I really think that Micro.Blog is the tip of the iceberg for a resurgence of the independent web. The service isn’t for everyone and it’s in the early days. Manton is still figuring out how some features will work, but I think it’s a great fit for me. (I’m going to write a lot more about Micro.Blog this month, including why I’m excited about it, and detailing how I configured my Squarespace blog to work with Micro.Blog.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reality check.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I’m not completely giving up on Twitter, though. I’ve been a Twitter user since 2007 and Twitter is part of my daily routine. It&rsquo;s just a less enjoyable part of my daily routine now. This year, I backed Twitteriffic for Mac on Kickstarter because I wanted my favorite Twitter client on my Mac.</p>
<p>Times are changing, though, and I honestly believe that we all need to be diversifying — and if possible, owning — our social media presence. Becoming less reliant on the big social media behemoths is the first step.</p>
<p>I look forward to revisiting my progress next year.</p>

			 <h2 id="what-would-happen-if-twitter-disappeared-tomorrow">What would happen if Twitter disappeared tomorrow?</h2>
<p><em>This post was originally posted on November 9, 2016 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve been on Twitter since 2007. It’s part of my daily routine and probably my most vital social media channel for finding and sharing news. But Twitter has had some lingering financial issues and when they recently tried to sell the company, no one stepped up to make an appropriate offer.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, a couple of social media experiments have crashed and burned lately. Twitter announced that they were closing Vine.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Talkshow had a bunch of potential but didn’t make it six months. And while Twitter is much larger, it’s not immune from financial reality.</p>
<p>Which got me thinking, what if we woke up one morning and Twitter was gone. Or more likely, what if Twitter changed so radically, that it was unusable? How would that change the way I get things done?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d lose a bunch of contacts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I follow a large number of designers, brands and local experts on Twitter — and no where else. If Twitter disappeared, I’d lose all those contacts and have to try and reconstruct the network on another channel. Not an easy task.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d change how I watch live events.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> During the World Series, I kept an eye on Twitter. During the presidential debates, I followed along on Twitter. During the University of South Carolina&rsquo;s football game last weekend, I kept up with the score on Twitter. During election night coverage, sigh. Twitter is the perfect companion to a live event and I’d miss seeing what my friends and family think in real time.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d have to rethink how I find articles and stories.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I find lots of inspirational links and content on Twitter. If Twitter goes away, I’m using RSS and Feedly much more aggressively.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d have to rethink how I share content.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I share most of my blog posts through Twitter. If Twitter were gone, I’d have to share them somewhere else like Facebook or Medium.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d change the way I use Facebook.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I use Facebook for family pictures and connecting with people I know and have met. If Twitter disappeared, I’d probably use Facebook more to connect with a wider audience. Maybe I’d invest more time into building the Sketchbook B page on Facebook. Post more links to articles on my Facebook feed. If Twitter goes away, my Facebook experience changes radically.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d spend more time on Instagram.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Because I love Instagram, almost as much as I love Twitter. And I’m going to have some free time if there is no Twitter.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’d try to find a replacement.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If Twitter disappeared, I imagine several companies would rush to unveil a replacement. Or modify their social product to attract Twitter refugees. You know Google would retool and rebrand Google Plus, Linked In might try to be less of a train wreck. Even Snapchat might try to appeal to former Twitter users. Startups would start, and fail. Someone would try to resurrect App.net. I’d try them all, but I’m not sure there can truly be a replacement for Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="but-reality">But… reality.</h3>
<p>So I don’t think Twitter will just shut down. At some point, the price to purchase the company gets so low, that someone will take a chance on them. I’m more concerned that Twitter, or a company that buys Twitter, will change it so completely, that it becomes useless.</p>
<p>This exercise had forced me, though, to start evaluating areas where I am too reliant on Twitter. I&rsquo;m going to start connecting to designers and thought leaders on other channels. I&rsquo;m looking for new avenues to find and share content. I&rsquo;ll evaluate how I use channels like Facebook, Instagram, Dribbble, YouTube and Medium.</p>
<p>Twitter might not disappear, but it&rsquo;s still best not to keep your eggs in one basket.</p>

<h2 id="real-jobs-have-deadlines">Real jobs have deadlines.</h2>
<p>As a designer, I hear &ldquo;As Soon As Possible&rdquo; an awful lot. Most people are shocked to learn that ASAP is actually my lowest priority. Jobs with concrete deadlines are always in line ahead of jobs with no real deadline.</p>
<p>Understanding why the client needs something ASAP is the first step in understanding whether you are dealing with a crisis or a &ldquo;crisis.&rdquo; There are a couple of reasons why clients avoid giving you a real deadline:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When can you get it to me? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the client is asking you to set a deadline, the project probably doesn&rsquo;t have a firm due date. It likely needs to be done quickly, but they don&rsquo;t want to look stupid and throw out a date that is impossible. Or they are hesitant to suggest a date that is too far out in the future. So they throw it back to you. In that case, sit down and start developing a schedule that works for everyone. If they need it faster, they&rsquo;ll let you know in the process of setting the timeline.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a rush!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> For some clients, everything is a rush. Every email is marked high priority. So don&rsquo;t overreact and rush into the project. Ask for a specific timeline. This is client&rsquo;s normal operating procedure so stick to yours. If it&rsquo;s a real rush, they will tell you.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s going to take forever!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Some clients have no idea how long a project is going to take. So they are anxious to get started. Asking for a deadline will diagnose that immediately. I once had a client call in a panic and rushed over to meet them only to find out that we had four months to complete a simple poster series. Crisis averted.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My boss wants it now! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sometimes, the client is panicked because their boss is on their back. They may not even know when the project is really needed. Work with them to set a schedule to share with their manager. Have them confirm the schedule will meet the manager&rsquo;s needs and get back to you. 99% of the time, the manager will be fine with the schedule.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I need it yesterday! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some clients ask for the world. And the ability to travel back in time. Setting a timeline is important here, but so are problem solving skills. I&rsquo;ve seen clients ask for 50,000 brochures on a very short turn, only to find out it was because they needed 1,000 for a trade show. (We ran the 1,000. Then ran the larger print run later.) The clients are typically panicked and aren&rsquo;t thinking straight. By focusing on the timeline, you can help them figure out what they really need and give them the best solution for their problem.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the client really is asking for the impossible. Tell them. But here&rsquo;s the key, after you tell them that you can&rsquo;t meet their deadline, tell them what you can do for them.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oops! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sometimes the client makes a mistake and forgets to make a request or communicate a deadline. And this is where you can play the hero. Set a timeline for how to get them what they need and do your best to help them out.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designers drop the ball sometimes, too.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If it&rsquo;s your fault, apologize and own the mistake. Then, move heaven and earth to make it right.</p>
<p>In every single one of these scenarios, communication is key. Be up front about the schedule, challenges and costs. Remember that the client is often under a lot of pressure and may not be thinking straight. Most importantly, don&rsquo;t take the ASAP request personally. Just view it as what it is&hellip; an opportunity to save the day and build a better relationship with your client.</p>

<p>All professionals need a personalized email address and a home on the web. And Gmail accounts and Facebook pages don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>I saw a branding consultant recently without a branded email address. Who hires a brand consultant who doesn&rsquo;t invest in their own brand?
I saw a company trying to recruit managers&hellip; just email an AOL account. (In case you are wondering, the company wasn&rsquo;t recruiting for AOL.)
I was trying to find out information on a store in town and all they had was a Facebook page that hadn&rsquo;t been updated in a couple of months.
I don&rsquo;t really care what your business is — from a home-based business to a large corporation — if you don&rsquo;t have a real email address with your own domain name, I&rsquo;m less likely to take you seriously. And if your only web presence is a Facebook page, you don&rsquo;t have a real business.</p>
<p>Look. I get it. It&rsquo;s easy to get by with the free accounts. A penny saved is a penny earned. Absolutely. But investing in a domain name and a Google apps account? It&rsquo;s not that expensive. Without your own domain, you send a message to all your clients and potential clients that you can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t invest in your own company.</p>
<p>It used to take some effort to get on the Web a decade ago, but now, services like Squarespace provide great solutions for small businesses and take care of hosting, e-commerce and more. Like Gmail? That&rsquo;s fine. You can customize your address with Google Apps. Other services like Hover can help you get your domain and email set up. There are seriously hundreds of services to help you look professional. It&rsquo;s not that hard and not that expensive.</p>
<p>Having a professional online appearance is every bit as important as dressing appropriately or speaking intelligently. It&rsquo;s a necessary investment that lets people know that you are serious about your business.</p>
<p>Unless you aren&rsquo;t serious about your business. And then, I guess, any email address or website will do.</p>

<p><em>This post was originally posted on September 29, 2015 on Sketchbook B. It&rsquo;s reposted here as part of a project to move some of my favorite writing to my new site.</em></p>
<p>A few years ago, I stopped at a fast food restaurant in rural, upstate South Carolina where a car was circling the drive thru over and over and over. She’d drive up to the ordering station and wait a second. Then the car would drive to the window, pause, and then drive around again. This happened a couple of times. It was very strange.</p>
<p>When I walked in, I nodded toward the car at the window and asked what was going on. The woman shrugged, obviously embarrassed, and said “Just improving the drive thru wait times…”</p>
<p>Lots of people wonder how something like the Volkswagen <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> emissions test scandal can happen. It’s actually very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a specific goal.</li>
<li>Figure out a test to measure it: a survey, a timer, a standardized test, etc.</li>
<li>Make sure everyone knows how important the test is.</li>
<li>Provide rewards for people who achieve the test objectives. And penalize people who don’t meet the test objectives.</li>
<li>Smart people will eventually figure out how to do well on the test, even if it now has nothing to do with the original goal.</li>
<li>Management pats themselves on the back for great test results.</li>
<li>The test no longer reflects reality.</li>
</ol>
<p>This cycle is everywhere in business today and manifests itself in different ways. Most of the time, it doesn&rsquo;t involve fraud and cheating. But this process is why:</p>
<ol>
<li>Engineers design products (cars, cell phones, etc.) that meet specific test objectives, but not real life usage.</li>
<li>Customer service reps in banks, car dealerships and retail stores remind you over and over to answer “highly satisfied” on a random survey.</li>
<li>Teachers teach to the test.</li>
<li>Managers make short sighted decisions to stay under budget.</li>
<li>Advertisers make really annoying online ads to improve click through rates.</li>
<li>Fast food workers fake drive thru response times.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you connect success on a metric to an employee’s financial well being, that employee will change their behavior to meet the test objectives. And yes, sometimes, if the pressure is great enough, they cheat.</p>
<p>I’m sure those fast food workers wanted to have good drive thru response times to make their boss happy. I doubt there was a financial incentive. Maybe if the boss was happy, their life would be easier. Or perhaps they were afraid of being fired. Whatever the reason, they cheated to meet their test objectives. They lost sight of — or more likely, were never told — the reason for the test.</p>
<p>The test itself isn’t the problem. Testing and evaluation is a key part of management in a corporate environment. But today, it’s really easy to test and measure everything. Over reliance on metrics in management makes the test more important than the goal. And that never ends well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll simply get what you test for.</p>

<p>Why are so many people and organizations obsessed with acronyms? Especially acronyms that spell another word. From small nonprofits and churches to schools and large corporations, really bad acronyms are everywhere.</p>
<p>NASA&rsquo;s Messenger Probe crashed into Mercury after a long and successful mission. And as I read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/30/us/nasa-mercury-messenger-space-probe-to-crash/index.html">CNN&rsquo;s account of the mission</a>, I was stunned by the fifth paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6½ years before it started circling Mercury on March 18, 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait. So the Messenger probe is actually M.E.S.S.E.N.G.E.R.? Or is it Me.S.S.En.Ge.R.?</p>
<p>NASA designed a space probe to fly to a planet named after the messenger of the gods. And NASA feels like they need to construct some bogus acronym to justify the name &ldquo;Messenger.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Acronyms are fine if they really help people remember and understand the program or product name. But in most cases, the acronym simply becomes a name and slowly loses all connection to the meaning.</p>
<p>And the worse case scenario is that you are so obsessed with creating an acronym, that you select a poor name in the process. Avoid creating acronyms just to be clever or just to justify a name choice.</p>
<p>Your best bet is always to give products, organizations and programs strong, appropriate names.</p>

<p>A little math problem for you…</p>
<p>One 15-minute PowerPoint<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> presentation has 5 slides. Another 15-minute PowerPoint presentation has 15 slides. Which presentation is shorter?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Obviously, both are 15-minute presentations. They are the same length.</p>
<p>But time and again, I talk to people who reduce the number of slides in their PowerPoint because they want to make the presentation “shorter.” They think that if they have fewer slides, they will talk for a shorter amount of time. Often, they don’t take material out, as much as they condense it on the remaining slides.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>That’s completely the wrong way to think about it.</p>
<p>Next time you have a presentation, think about how long you have to present and build your story to fill the allotted time. Then create an appropriate number of slides to support your presentation. You may have more slides and move through them quickly. Or only a handful of slides.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But remember that the length of your presentation has almost nothing to do with how many slides you have.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
